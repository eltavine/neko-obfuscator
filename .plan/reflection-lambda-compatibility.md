# Reflection and lambda compatibility plan

## Non-negotiable constraints

- Preserve all JVM obfuscation invariants from `AGENTS.md`: no fallback behavior, no reduced transform coverage, no reflection/lambda special-case deobfuscation, no plaintext reflective application data, no static key exposure, and no removal of reflective or lambda obfuscation surfaces.
- Build a fresh baseline before using any existing `build/test-jvm-full-obf-perf/` artifacts as evidence.
- Do not touch unrelated current native-code/test work shown by `git status --short`.
- Do not use repository `./gradlew` until the user grants permission.
- Do not create files or folders under `/tmp`.

## Current evidence

- User reports current compatibility problems around reflection calls and lambda calls under thick/full JVM obfuscation.
- The repository already has `JvmFullObfuscationPerfTest`, which creates `build/test-jvm-full-obf-perf/`, obfuscates TEST/obfusjack/SnakeGame/evaluator with `test-jars/full-jvm-obf.yml`, runs runnable original and full-obfuscated fixtures, and writes `jvm-full-obf-performance-baseline.json`.
- Existing `build/test-jvm-full-obf-perf/` outputs are stale for this task and must not be used as proof until regenerated.
- `git status --short` shows unrelated modified native-code/test files and untracked cache/import-looking files; this task must avoid changing or reverting them.

## Subtasks

[x] RLC-1: Regenerate fresh full-obf baseline

- Scope: Remove only stale baseline outputs under `build/test-jvm-full-obf-perf/` if needed, then run the existing full JVM obfuscation baseline test to regenerate artifacts from current sources. Do not modify transform code in this subtask.
- Required evidence: Fresh command output from the baseline run, fresh timestamps/artifacts in `build/test-jvm-full-obf-perf/`, and captured original/full-obfuscated stdout/stderr for runnable fixtures.
- Validation command/runtime target: After user approval for repository `./gradlew`, run `env GRADLE_USER_HOME=.gradle-user-home ./gradlew :neko-test:test --rerun-tasks --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.JvmFullObfuscationPerfTest`.
- Completion criteria: Fresh TEST and obfusjack original/full-obf run logs exist; pass/fail output identifies the current compatibility failure without relying on stale artifacts; no source files are edited.
- Completion evidence: After explicit user permission for the repository Gradle wrapper, stale `build/test-jvm-full-obf-perf/` outputs were removed and the validation command completed with `BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 13s`, `19 actionable tasks: 19 executed`. The fresh report at `build/test-jvm-full-obf-perf/jvm-full-obf-performance-baseline.json` was captured at `2026-05-15T04:42:17.936535299Z`. Fresh TEST logs show the original jar reports `Test 2.1: Counter PASS`, `Test 2.5: Loader PASS`, `Test 2.6: ReTrace PASS`, and `Test 2.7: Annotation PASS`, while the full-obfuscated jar reports `ERROR` for those four reflection-heavy checks. Fresh obfusjack original and full-obfuscated logs both complete with `=== All tests completed ===`; randomized PRNG and timing lines differ as expected for that fixture.

[x] RLC-2: Identify exact reflective/lambda failing invariant

- Scope: From the fresh baseline failure and generated artifacts, identify the exact runtime path, bytecode site, transformed descriptor/name/key metadata, and output divergence for reflection or lambda calls. Use generated jars/logs only from RLC-1.
- Required evidence: Exact failing fixture, class/method/site, original vs obfuscated output difference or exception, and the transform metadata/instruction sequence proving the root cause.
- Validation command/runtime target: Re-run only the failing generated jar or focused fixture command needed to prove the path after RLC-1, without changing code.
- Completion criteria: A concrete evidence chain exists before implementation; no speculation-based code change is made.
- Completion evidence:
  - Re-ran the fresh full-obfuscated TEST artifact with `java -Xint -Xlog:exceptions=info -XX:-UsePerfData -jar build/test-jvm-full-obf-perf/TEST-full-jvm-obf.jar` and captured `build/inspect/test-full-obf-xint-exceptions.txt`. The fresh run still reports `Test 2.1: Counter ERROR`, `Test 2.5: Loader ERROR`, `Test 2.6: ReTrace ERROR`, `Test 2.7: Annotation ERROR`, and `Test 2.8: Sec ERROR`.
  - Loader root cause: `a/da` (`pack/tests/reflects/loader/LTest`) is loaded by custom loader `a/ea`, and its constructor directly invokes package-shared CFF helper `a/a.b([Ljava/lang/Object;IIII)I` at bci 148. `a/a.b` is generated from `pack/Clazz` as package-private `static int b(Object[], int, int, int, int)`. JVM runtime packages include the defining class loader, so `a/da` in loader `a/ea` is not in the same runtime package as app-loader `a/a`; the VM throws `IllegalAccessError`. Source owner: `CffClassSetup.ensureSharedClassHelpers` installs package-shared helpers with only `ACC_STATIC | ACC_SYNTHETIC` unless the helper owner is an interface.
  - Method-array reflection root cause: `CffReflectionMemberFilters.injectedMethodFilter` emits `IFNE skip` followed by unconditional `GOTO syntheticDone`, then an unreachable `Method.getModifiers`/`Modifier.isStatic` check. This malformed injected method-array filter is inserted before CFF and becomes flattened. The failing Counter path reaches this generated method-array filtering path after `Class.getDeclaredMethods`/indy result materialization and then traps in CFF (`a/y.ia` via `a/y.a` at bci 6468). The source invariant is that generated reflection filters must be structurally valid control flow and hide generated synthetic static members without introducing unreachable control-flow islands.
  - Reflective invoke/key-transfer root cause: ReTrace and Annotation reflectively invoke methods whose final ABI is the packed `Object[]` carrier with hidden key material. `JvmMethodParameterObfuscationPass.rewriteReflectiveInvoke` currently wraps the caller-supplied `Method.invoke` argument array as the inner carrier, and `emitRuntimeReflectiveKeySelection` writes the transferred key into the last existing argument slot only when the array is non-empty. It does not allocate the final carrier shape, does not preserve all original user arguments, and does not handle zero-argument reflective calls. This explains `a/ga.x([Ljava/lang/Object;)V` and `a/x.a([Ljava/lang/Object;)V` entering with wrong or missing hidden key material and trapping in CFF. Source owner: `JvmMethodParameterObfuscationPass.rewriteReflectiveInvoke`, `emitRuntimeReflectiveKeySelection`, and candidate matching around reflective `Method.invoke`.

[x] RLC-3: Patch generic compatibility rewriting

- Scope: Modify the JVM transform architecture at the source of the proven invariant violation. Preserve reflection/lambda obfuscation, Object[] carriers, hidden long keys, dynamic key propagation, CFF, invokedynamic, string, constant, and renamer compatibility. No fallback, skip, helper-layer bypass, or plaintext exposure.
- Required evidence: Source-level mapping from the failing transformed site to the generic rewrite bug and all affected callsite families.
- Validation command/runtime target: Run the smallest focused Gradle test covering the changed path, then regenerate the full-obf baseline.
- Completion criteria: The failing reflective/lambda path is corrected generically; affected tests pass; no forbidden fallback or obfuscation weakening is introduced.
- Completion evidence: Generic source fixes were applied in the transform architecture: package-shared generated CFF/indy/string helpers now use `public static synthetic` access so transformed classes loaded by different class loaders can call the same obfuscated helper without a runtime-package `IllegalAccessError`; `CffReflectionMemberFilters.injectedMethodFilter` now implements the intended `synthetic && static` member filter instead of jumping over the static check; `JvmMethodParameterObfuscationPass` now builds final reflective `Method.invoke` packed carriers, injects live caller key material into the final ABI, resolves literal and dynamic reflective lookup owners through stack-source analysis, and narrows dynamic-name reflective split-hidden-key suppression to exact owner/parameter candidates when parameter types are statically recoverable. The dynamic ReTrace failure was proven by fresh `-Xint -Xlog:exceptions=info` output as `IllegalStateException` in `a/ga.x([Ljava/lang/Object;)V` reached through `a/ga.w([Ljava/lang/Object;J)V` reflective invoke; after the patch the fresh full-obf TEST run reports `Test 2.6: ReTrace PASS`.

[x] RLC-4: Final full-obf parity and hardening audit

- Scope: Regenerate `build/test-jvm-full-obf-perf/` after the fix, run runnable original and full-obfuscated jars, compare outputs, and inspect transformed artifacts for forbidden weakening markers.
- Required evidence: Fresh TEST/obfusjack original and full-obf logs after the fix; output parity evidence; static inspection showing no runtime helper class injection or forbidden fallback markers introduced by the fix.
- Validation command/runtime target: `env GRADLE_USER_HOME=.gradle-user-home ./gradlew :neko-test:test --rerun-tasks --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.JvmFullObfuscationPerfTest` plus targeted artifact inspection commands using repository tools.
- Completion criteria: Fresh full-obf artifacts run with outputs consistent with original jars for runnable fixtures; reflection/lambda call points remain obfuscated; no stale artifact is used as proof.
- Completion evidence: Fresh validation command completed with `BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 13s`, `19 actionable tasks: 19 executed`, regenerating `build/test-jvm-full-obf-perf/jvm-full-obf-performance-baseline.json` captured at `2026-05-15T05:09:42.819639395Z`. Fresh TEST full-obf stdout now reports `Counter PASS`, `Loader PASS`, `ReTrace PASS`, and `Annotation PASS`; `Sec ERROR` remains consistent with the original fixture's Java 21 security-manager behavior. Fresh obfusjack full-obf stdout completes with `=== All tests completed ===`. The test's built-in hardening audit accepted the full-obf artifacts with no runtime helper class injection or forbidden old helper descriptors. Additional source audit of the changed transform files found no JNI/JVMTI/original-bytecode fallback path added by this fix. The dynamic-reflection targeting optimization narrowed owner-wide split-hidden-key suppression to exact owner/parameter candidates when recoverable; the fresh report shows TEST output size reduced from 1,174,031 to 1,156,620 bytes and obfusjack Seq improved from 366ms to 350ms compared with the immediately preceding repaired run, while the remaining full-obf Calc/Seq overhead is outside the reflection/lambda compatibility change path.
