# Native Post-Transfer Performance and Compile-Time Execution Plan - 2026-05-19

## Scope

Continue the current native work after the native transfer/JNI-removal stages by
executing one evidence-backed optimization at a time across two tracks:

- runtime/native-transfer performance: `native-gentle-flamingo-todo.md` Stage 4
  and `native-performance-optimization-todo.md` P3+;
- native compile-time/code-shape performance: continuation after
  `.plan/native-compile-parallelization-2026-05-17.md` P41.

This document is the matching `.plan/` audit queue for the current work. It does
not replace the existing source plans; each implementation row below must update
the source plan that owns the changed path before it can be considered complete.

## Status Legend

- `[ ]` not implemented / not freshly verified
- `[-]` actively in progress only while that exact row is being worked
- `[x]` implemented, freshly regenerated, runtime-verified, inspected, and
  committed where repository policy permits
- `[rejected]` measured and reverted or not retained because acceptance failed

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

- Do not implement or optimize for a special jar, benchmark, class, method,
  owner, descriptor, crash site, or log string.
- Do not weaken JVM ABI behavior, obfuscation coverage, CFF/key-flow semantics,
  native coverage, GC compatibility, or JNI-removal goals.
- Do not add JNI fallback, JVMTI, skip-on-error success, original-bytecode
  fallback, Java helper layers, or new bootstrap behavior.
- Do not reuse stale jars, stale generated C, stale manifests, unit-only passes,
  or compile-only results as runtime proof.
- Use a repository-local temporary directory such as `build/native-run-tmp` for
  runtime commands; do not use `/tmp`.
- Repository `./gradlew` use requires explicit user permission before running.

## Existing Plan State Reconciled Before Implementation

- `native-gentle-flamingo-todo.md` Stage 4 remains open. T4.0 is first in the
  Stage 4 ordering because `neko_exception_check_resolve_env_offset` is recorded
  as a structural post-transfer performance prerequisite before the wider T4.14
  performance gate.
- `native-performance-optimization-todo.md` has P0/P1 complete. P2 is blocked by
  GC strict prerequisites. P3 is partially implemented by
  `.plan/native-compile-parallelization-2026-05-17.md` P25 but still needs the
  broader dependency-jar stack-trace fixture and GC strict compatibility gate.
  P4-P15 remain open.
- `.plan/native-compile-parallelization-2026-05-17.md` has accepted work through
  P41. Rejected rows P27/P29/P33/P34/P36/P37/P40 must not be retried in the same
  shape without new root-cause evidence explaining the rejection.
- `.plan/native-full-validation.md` V1-V3 remain open as a final validation
  sweep, and `.plan/native-full-repair.md` R2-R5 remain open for full native-only
  repair/acceptance.

## Execution Rows

### [x] NPT-0: Reconcile current native performance and compile-time plan state

- Scope: locate the active runtime performance, native transfer, compile-time,
  full-validation, and full-repair plans before changing code.
- Required evidence: exact file paths, open rows, validation targets, rejected
  shapes, and current generated-artifact locations.
- Validation command or runtime target: read-only repository exploration; no
  Gradle or runtime command.
- Completion criteria: this document records the current source-plan state and
  the next executable rows without inventing a bottleneck or changing runtime
  behavior.
- Evidence: completed read-only exploration of
  `native-performance-optimization-todo.md`, `native-gentle-flamingo-todo.md`,
  `.plan/native-compile-parallelization-2026-05-17.md`,
  `.plan/native-full-validation.md`, and `.plan/native-full-repair.md`.

### [x] NPT-1: Capture fresh post-P41 baseline before the next optimization

- Scope: regenerate and measure the current accepted source state after P41 so
  both runtime and compile-time work starts from fresh artifacts, not the stale
  P41 evidence embedded in the plan.
- Required evidence: git revision/status, focused native audit output, fresh
  native-only generation rows for TEST/test21/SnakeGame/evaluator, per-source
  compile/link elapsed rows, generated source counts, packaged library sizes,
  direct runtime stdout/stderr for TEST/test21/evaluator/SnakeGame smoke, parsed
  TEST Calc and test21 Platform/Virtual/Seq/Parallel/VThreads timings, newest
  `hs_err_pid*.log` scan, and generated-C forbidden-marker inspection.
- Validation command or runtime target: after explicit permission to use
  `./gradlew`, run the focused native audit/tests needed to regenerate native
  artifacts, then run native-only generation through `.plan/native-only-full.yml`
  and direct jar commands with `-Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp`.
- Completion criteria: regenerated artifacts report `translated>0 rejected=0`,
  no native compilation fallback, no skip-on-error success, no original-bytecode
  fallback, no executable forbidden JNI/JVMTI markers, no fatal JVM/runtime
  errors, and the next runtime plus compile-time rows are selected from the
  fresh measurements.
- Partial evidence: focused Gradle audit passed after explicit `./gradlew`
  permission with
  `./gradlew :neko-test:test --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.CCodeGeneratorTest
  --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest
  -Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp`. Exit code `0`; Gradle reported
  `BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 8s` with 19 actionable tasks. This is only the focused
  audit checkpoint; NPT-1 remains open until fresh four-jar native-only
  generation, direct runtime runs, manifest/timing capture, `hs_err` scan, and
  forbidden-marker inspection are complete.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-20 at git `4f537f98685afee2debcea9b6e1eb0b2d0a9017a`
  with clean worktree before generation: focused Gradle audit reran after
  explicit permission and passed with
  `./gradlew :neko-test:test --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.CCodeGeneratorTest
  --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest
  -Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp` (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s`, 19
  up-to-date tasks). Fresh `.plan/native-only-full.yml` CLI generation wrote
  `build/native-post-transfer-baseline/{TEST,obfusjack,SnakeGame,evaluator}-native-only.jar`;
  generated counts / translated rows were TEST 67 C files, `translated=49
  rejected=0`; obfusjack 113 C files, `translated=93 rejected=0`; SnakeGame 35
  C files, `translated=18 rejected=0`; evaluator 143 C files, `translated=122
  rejected=0`. Direct runtime logs under `build/native-post-transfer-baseline/`
  had no fatal markers: TEST x5 Calc = 34/39/34/36/35 ms; obfusjack x5
  completed with Seq = 29/28/29/28/29 ms, Parallel = 3/3/3/3/3 ms, VThreads =
  5/7/5/6/6 ms, Platform = 813/771/767/894/865 ms, Virtual =
  793/812/814/892/932 ms; SnakeGame exited with expected headless behavior;
  evaluator exited 0. No `hs_err_pid*.log` was created under
  `build/native-run-tmp`, `build/native-post-transfer-baseline`, or
  `build/neko-native-work`; newest root `hs_err_pid1039252.log` predates this
  run. Generated-C executable-marker inspection in
  `build/native-post-transfer-baseline/native-post-transfer-baseline-summary.json`
  found zero `NEKO_JNI_FN_PTR`, `(*env)->`, `env->`, function-table indexing,
  JNI call wrappers, array JNI wrappers, or JVMTI markers. Compile totals/top
  rows are recorded in the same summary JSON.

### [ ] NPT-2: Stage 4 T4.0 eager exception-check env-offset publication

- Scope: implement the Stage 4.A structural performance prerequisite from
  `native-gentle-flamingo-todo.md` T4.0: ensure
  `neko_exception_check_resolve_env_offset` is not reachable from the hot
  `neko_exception_check` path after publication.
- Required evidence: current generated C and runtime logs proving the resolver
  can still be reached from hot exception-check sites, the exact publication
  invariant chosen (`JNI_OnLoad` bootstrap, first dispatcher entry, TLS cache, or
  outlined unlikely helper), and generated C proving the hot path is an
  acquire-load plus pointer arithmetic plus `_pending_exception` read.
- Validation command or runtime target: `R-build`, `R-test` x5,
  `R-obfusjack` x5, `R-native-obfusjack` x10, `R-inspect`, and `R-negative` as
  specified by T4.0, with fresh artifacts only.
- Completion criteria: perf/debug evidence shows at most one env-offset
  derivation per process, missing-offset paths hard abort, TEST Calc and
  obfusjack timing gates do not regress, and generated/runtime inspection shows
  no new JNI function-table use or fallback path.
- Dependency: NPT-1, unless a plan-level update records why a narrower fresh
  baseline is sufficient.

### [-] NPT-3: Runtime P4 const fast-state accessor layer

- Scope: implement `native-performance-optimization-todo.md` P4 after the T4.0
  hot exception-check path is stable: post-bootstrap immutable fast-state
  accessors should read `g_hotspot_const` instead of mutable-looking
  `g_hotspot`, while collector-dynamic values such as ZGC mask pointers remain
  mutable.
- Required evidence: generated C/source inspection proving which accessors are
  immutable after bootstrap, which collector fields must remain dynamic, and how
  the changed accessors are used by hot helpers.
- Validation command or runtime target: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`,
  `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, performance gate, and GC strict compatibility
  gate from `native-performance-optimization-todo.md` P4.
- Completion criteria: generated C or compiler diagnostics show the intended
  immutable reads use `g_hotspot_const`, dynamic GC mask paths remain mutable,
  TEST/obfusjack runtime and GC gates pass with fresh artifacts, and no ABI,
  GC, JNI-removal, or fallback invariant is weakened.
- Dependency update: NPT-1 fresh generated C shows T4.0's structural hot path
  is already present in current source: `neko_exception_check` reads
  `g_neko_off_thread_jni_environment_for_check` directly, and the cold
  resolver is driven from `neko_method_layout_init`, not from the hot path.
  The remaining measured gap is performance, so P4 is the next generic
  post-bootstrap invariant optimization before revisiting wider T4.0/T4.14
  gates.
- P4 implementation evidence 2026-05-20: changed only
  `NativeHotSpotFastAccessEmitter` const accessors so post-bootstrap immutable
  fields read `g_hotspot_const`; source and generated C keep ZGC live-mask
  helpers on mutable `g_hotspot.z_zglobals_*` pointers. Focused Gradle audit
  passed:
  `./gradlew :neko-test:test --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.CCodeGeneratorTest
  --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest
  -Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp` (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 6s`).
  Fresh `.plan/native-only-full.yml` artifacts in
  `build/native-post-transfer-p4/` report TEST `translated=49 rejected=0`,
  obfusjack `translated=93 rejected=0`, SnakeGame `translated=18 rejected=0`,
  evaluator `translated=122 rejected=0`; generated TEST C
  `build/neko-native-work/run-3244581472985/neko_native_support.c` shows all
  `neko_const_*` immutable accessors reading `g_hotspot_const`, while dynamic
  ZGC mask helpers still read mutable mask pointers. Runtime: TEST x5 Calc =
  35/35/35/33/34 ms; obfusjack x5 completed with Seq = 23/23/23/22/25 ms,
  Parallel = 3/3/3/3/3 ms, VThreads = 4/5/6/4/5 ms. SnakeGame preserved
  headless behavior; evaluator exited 0. `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`
  passed (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 40s`). P4 remains `[-]` rather than `[x]`
  because the full performance gate still misses TEST Calc <= 20 ms and GC
  strict remains blocked: ZGC/Shenandoah abort at existing mask publication
  diagnostics (`ZGC oop load masks unavailable addr=0x0 good=0x0`), and
  Parallel/Serial obfusjack direct runs did not provide a clean strict-gate
  completion under the 240s direct-run cap.
- User-updated acceptance recorded 2026-05-20: Calc must match or beat the
  original JVM jar in the same run environment; obfusjack Seq must be <= 10 ms;
  every other parsed benchmark/test timing must match original or stay within
  1.5x slowdown. Older absolute threshold rows are superseded for ongoing
  performance work.

### [-] NPT-3a: Runtime P10 generic NJX call-parameter packing

- Scope: continue runtime performance work by optimizing only the generic
  native-to-Java call-stub machinery used to jump to original JVM methods.
  This row must not add owner/name/descriptor-specific native implementations.
- Required evidence: audit of current translator/codegen special cases, rollback
  of the uncommitted `java/lang/Math` → C libm lowering, source/generated-C
  proof that Math calls still bind and jump through NJX to the original JVM
  methods, and generated-C proof that full `memset(call_params, ...)` is gone
  while every used call parameter slot and required two-slot padding word is
  explicitly initialized.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests with
  repository `./gradlew` after permission, then the owning P10 runtime gate
  before marking complete.
- Completion criteria: no `translateMathIntrinsicInvoke`, libm call, or `-lm`
  link flag remains; generated C contains bound `java/lang/Math` method entries
  rather than native math calls; NJX stack packing preserves the previous zeroed
  high/padding words without full-array memset; no JNI/JVMTI/original-bytecode
  fallback or target-method control-flow replacement is introduced.
- Evidence update 2026-05-20: rolled back the forbidden `java/lang/Math` native
  intrinsic route and removed the unused method-specific native helper bodies
  for `String.length`, `Object.getClass`, `String.concat`, and
  `Atomic*.addAndGet`. Source audit over `neko-native/src/main/java` found no
  remaining `translateMathIntrinsicInvoke`, libm `sqrt`/`pow`, `-lm`, or those
  fast helper definitions; generated audit over
  `build/neko-native-work/run-5500725993204` found no emitted forbidden helper
  symbols or libm calls. The remaining `translateIntrinsicMethodInvoke` cases
  are caller/stack compatibility bridges, not performance replacements.
- Evidence update 2026-05-20: retained only generic native-to-Java machinery
  changes: explicit NJX `call_params` slot initialization, shape-specialized
  call-stub parameter packing, receiver inline-cache keys derived from the
  already-resolved `Klass*`, and fused nested-array helper cleanup that removes
  a duplicate outer-bounds check after the same check has already succeeded.
  These changes preserve the original JVM/JDK target call; no named target
  method body is implemented in native code.
- Validation update 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed with
  `./gradlew :neko-test:test --rerun-tasks --tests
  dev.nekoobfuscator.test.CCodeGeneratorTest --tests
  dev.nekoobfuscator.test.OpcodeTranslatorUnitTest --tests
  dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest
  -Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp` (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, artifact
  `artifact://112`). Full native integration passed with
  `./gradlew :neko-test:test --rerun-tasks --tests
  dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest
  -Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp` (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, artifact
  `artifact://114`).
- Open gate evidence 2026-05-20: parity is still not accepted. Fresh repeated
  direct runs written to
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-current/summary-after-generic.json` recorded
  TEST original/native Calc medians `12 ms` / `135 ms`; obfusjack
  original/native medians Seq `2 ms` / `19 ms`, Platform `25 ms` / `50 ms`,
  Virtual `15 ms` / `47 ms`. This row remains `[-]`; no checkpoint commit is
  valid until the parity gate is met or the retained subset is split into an
  accepted, freshly validated prerequisite row.
  - Evidence update 2026-05-20: read-only forbidden-substitution audit
    `agent://8-ForbiddenNativeSubstitutionAudit` found no remaining
    owner/name/descriptor-specific performance replacements for Math/libm,
    String.length/concat, Object.getClass, Atomic addAndGet, or similar
    targets in the requested native translator/codegen files. Remaining named
    cases are compatibility bridges that call cached original JVM Method*
    targets through NJX.

### [rejected] NPT-3b: Runtime P10 compiled-entry NJX bridge prototype

- Scope: replace the shape-specialized NJX call-stub bridge with the existing
  generic compiled-entry trampoline path only if the trampoline calls each
  supplied Method* `_from_compiled_entry` target unchanged. This must not
  implement any owner/name/descriptor-specific Java/JDK method in native code
  and must not alter translated-target selection.
- Required evidence: source and generated-C proof that direct, virtual, helper,
  reflection-adapter, String concat/valueOf, and implicit-exception NJX sites
  pass compiled-entry pointers when the bridge expects compiled entries; proof
  that each generated shape is keyed only by ABI shape; runtime logs or
  generated C proving original JVM/JDK methods are still invoked by Method*
  entry pointers instead of native replacements.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests with
  repository `./gradlew`, `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct TEST and
  obfusjack parity runs under `-Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp`, and
  generated-C forbidden-marker inspection. If any runtime, verifier, GC-root,
  stack-walk, or parity gate fails, revert this row before trying another
  optimization.
- Completion criteria: fresh artifacts report `translated>0 rejected=0`; no
  fatal JVM/runtime errors, JNI/JVMTI wrappers, fallback markers, or native
  method-body substitutions are present; TEST Calc and obfusjack parsed
  timings move toward same-run original JVM parity without replacing original
  target calls.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://151`), but fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` failed with
  repeated SIGSEGVs in HotSpot stack walking / `Throwable.fillInStackTrace`
  while frames crossed `~BufferBlob::neko_njx_trampoline` (`artifact://153`,
  `artifact://155`, `hs_err_pid1442764.log`, `hs_err_pid1500630.log`).
  Adjusting the synthetic BufferBlob frame size from `8 + stackArgs + pad` to
  `9 + stackArgs + pad` did not remove the crash. The compiled-entry bridge
  prototype was reverted before any checkpoint commit because it violates the
  row's stack-walk/runtime acceptance criteria.

### [x] NPT-3c: Runtime P10 call_stub guard register-save trim

- Scope: optimize only the generic HotSpot call_stub bridge used by
  shape-specialized NJX dispatchers. The bridge must keep calling the supplied
  original Method* entry and must not introduce any owner/name/descriptor
  native implementation.
- Required evidence: the current guarded bridge saves callee-saved registers
  around a C-ABI call to HotSpot `call_stub`; the proposed change may remove
  only wrapper-local redundant saves while preserving SysV stack alignment and
  the two stack-passed call_stub arguments. Generated C must still call
  `neko_call_stub_guarded` / `g_neko_call_stub_entry` with the same Method* and
  entry pointers.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct TEST and obfusjack parity runs, and
  generated-C forbidden-marker inspection under
  `-Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp`.
- Completion criteria: fresh artifacts run without SIGSEGV/SIGABRT/verifier
  errors, no forbidden JNI/JVMTI/fallback or method-body substitution appears,
  and same-run direct timings improve or do not regress versus the committed
  call_stub baseline.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-20: removed the wrapper-local callee-saved
  register pushes/pops and alignment-only `subq $8` from
  `neko_call_stub_guarded`; the bridge still passes the same call_stub, Method*,
  entry pointer, parameter stack, result buffer, and JavaThread arguments to
  HotSpot. Focused generator/audit tests passed (`artifact://167`) and
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed (`artifact://169`). Fresh direct
  parity runs under `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10c/` completed with no
  fatal markers: TEST original/native Calc medians `11 ms` / `134 ms`;
  obfusjack original/native medians Seq `2 ms` / `18 ms`, Platform
  `26 ms` / `50 ms`, Virtual `15 ms` / `44 ms`. Generated C inspection in
  `build/neko-native-work/run-7465333913274/neko_native_support.c` preserved
  call_stub dispatch and did not reintroduce Math/libm or named JDK native
  substitutions. The row is an accepted generic call_stub bridge micro-
  optimization, but P10 remains open because same-run original JVM parity is
  still not achieved.

### [rejected] NPT-3d: Runtime P10 bounded JavaCallWrapper zeroing

- Scope: reduce per-NJX-call stack zeroing in the call_stub bridge by clearing
  only the generated JavaCallWrapper prefix that is actually populated and
  whose frame-anchor extent is already validated before every call. This must
  keep the same HotSpot call_stub target, Method*, entry pointer, arguments,
  result handling, handle scope, and thread-state transitions.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that the cleared byte count covers
  the thread, JNIHandleBlock, Method*, receiver, and JavaFrameAnchor fp/pc/sp
  fields before call_stub observes the wrapper; runtime validation must reject
  any stack-walk, exception, GC-root, or verifier failure.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct TEST and obfusjack parity runs, and
  generated-C forbidden-marker inspection under
  `-Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp`.
- Completion criteria: no SIGSEGV/SIGABRT/verifier/fatal markers; no forbidden
  JNI/JVMTI/fallback or named method-body substitutions; same-run direct
  timings improve or do not regress relative to the NPT-3c checkpoint.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://179`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://181`), but fresh direct parity runs in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10d/` regressed against the NPT-3c checkpoint:
  TEST native Calc median `136 ms` vs `134 ms`; obfusjack native Seq
  `19 ms` vs `18 ms`; Virtual `46 ms` vs `44 ms` while Platform remained
  `50 ms`. The bounded-zeroing source change was reverted before any
  implementation checkpoint because the row's no-regression criterion was not
  met.

### [rejected] NPT-3e: Runtime P10 Java-thread-state hot branch

- Scope: optimize only the generic NJX call_stub thread-state precheck by making
  the already-required `_thread_in_java` path the predicted fallthrough. Native
  callers must still transition through `neko_transition_native_to_java`; any
  unsupported state must still hard abort.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that the same call_stub Method*
  and entry pointers are used and that only branch shape changed.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3c.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://186`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://188`), but direct timing did not meet the no-regression gate.
  Partial five-run parity in `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10e/` recorded TEST
  native Calc values `137/132/136/137/134 ms`; the obfusjack native series hit
  a 120s timeout during the third repeated run. A follow-up three-run obfusjack
  native check under `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10e-extra/` completed but
  showed Platform `53/53/52 ms` versus the NPT-3c median `50 ms`. The branch
  hint source change was reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3f: Runtime P10 direct call_stub guard arguments

- Scope: remove the per-NJX-call temporary `neko_call_stub_args_t` aggregate
  from the generic call_stub bridge and pass the same call_stub arguments
  directly through the guard function's C ABI. The guard must still invoke the
  supplied HotSpot `call_stub` with the same JavaCallWrapper mirror, Method*,
  entry pointer, parameter stack, result buffer, result type, and JavaThread.
- Required evidence: generated-C proof that the guard call is still shape-
  generic and not owner/name/descriptor-specific; source proof that the x86-64
  SysV stack-passed `size` and `thread` arguments keep correct alignment.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3c.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://199`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://201`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10f/` regressed against NPT-3c on TEST Calc
  and obfusjack Platform/Virtual: TEST native Calc median `136 ms` vs `134 ms`;
  obfusjack native Seq improved `17 ms` vs `18 ms`, but Platform was
  `51 ms` vs `50 ms` and Virtual was `45 ms` vs `44 ms`. The direct-argument
  source/test changes were reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3g: Runtime P11 conditional JNIHandleBlock `_last` publication

- Scope: optimize the generic local-handle push paths by writing
  `JNIHandleBlock::_last` only when a previously empty active block receives
  its first pushed handle. Overflow block creation must still initialize its
  own `_last`, and restore must still restore the saved `_last` value.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that every active block with
  `_top > 0` still has `_last == block` before HotSpot can allocate into it,
  while repeated pushes into the same non-empty block avoid redundant `_last`
  stores. This must apply generically to signature-dispatch and raw-oop return
  handle paths, not to a benchmark-specific method.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/GC-root/forbidden-marker regressions
  and same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3c.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://206`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://208`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10g/` did not meet the no-regression gate.
  TEST native Calc values were `132/133/137/138/138 ms` (median `137 ms`,
  worse than NPT-3c `134 ms`), and the obfusjack native repeated run timed out
  once at 180s after four completed runs. The conditional `_last` source
  changes were reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [x] NPT-3h: Runtime P10 return-kind-specific NJX result loads

- Scope: optimize only shape-specialized NJX call_stub result unpacking by
  loading `__call_result` according to the known return kind: integer/object
  returns read the integer lane, float/double returns read the FP lane, and
  void returns read neither. The HotSpot call_stub target, Method*, entry
  pointer, argument stack, exception behavior, handle scope, and target method
  selection must remain unchanged.
- Required evidence: generated-C proof that each shape still uses the same
  call_stub bridge and only omits dead result-lane loads for return kinds that
  cannot observe them.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3c.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-20: shape-specialized NJX dispatchers now load
  only the result lane required by their return kind: void shapes skip
  `__call_result` reads, integer/object shapes load `out_rax`, and FP shapes
  copy only `out_xmm0`. Focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://214`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://216`). Fresh direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10h/` completed with no fatal markers: TEST
  original/native Calc medians `12 ms` / `134 ms`; obfusjack original/native
  medians Seq `2 ms` / `17 ms`, Platform `26 ms` / `50 ms`, Virtual
  `14 ms` / `44 ms`. Generated-C inspection of
  `build/neko-native-work/run-9173021508276/neko_native_support.c` shows
  call_stub dispatch is still used and the old combined
  `out_rax = ...; memcpy(&out_xmm0, ...)` unpack is gone from shape bodies.
  The row is accepted as a generic bridge micro-optimization; full P10 parity
  remains open.

### [rejected] NPT-3i: Runtime P10 single-slot NJX result buffer

- Scope: reduce the shape-specialized NJX call_stub result buffer from two
  machine words to the single `intptr_t` word needed to hold any JVM primitive
  or object return lane on the supported 64-bit targets. The call_stub result
  pointer and BasicType must remain unchanged, and void/integer/object/FP
  returns must preserve their existing semantics.
- Required evidence: generated-C proof that the buffer remains at least
  `sizeof(intptr_t)` and all result unpacking reads only that word after
  NPT-3h. This must be shape-generic and not target a method owner/name.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://221`), but fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` failed in
  `nativeObfuscation_randomRuntimeStableTenRuns` because
  `obfusjack-native.jar` timed out after 45s (`artifact://223`). The
  single-slot result-buffer source change was reverted before any
  implementation checkpoint because the runtime stability gate failed.

### [rejected] NPT-3j: Runtime P10 constant-index NJX call parameter packing

- Scope: optimize only shape-specialized NJX call parameter packing by emitting
  constant `call_params` slot indexes for each known ABI shape instead of the
  mutable `__njx_pos` cursor. The exact slot layout, two-slot long/double
  padding word, object handle unwrapping, Method*, entry pointer, and call_stub
  behavior must remain unchanged.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that generated shapes use fixed
  slot indexes and still preserve the existing zero-padding semantics for
  one-slot primitives and two-slot long/double arguments.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://227`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://229`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10j/` did not meet the no-regression gate.
  TEST native Calc values were `140/140/133/136/134 ms` (median `136 ms`,
  worse than NPT-3h `134 ms`), and the obfusjack native repeated run timed out
  once at 180s after three completed runs. The constant-index packing source
  change was reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3k: Runtime P10 return-kind-specific NJX result locals

- Scope: continue NPT-3h by emitting only the result local variables and debug
  log arguments required by each shape return kind. Integer/object shapes need
  only `out_rax`, FP shapes need only `out_xmm0`, and void shapes need neither.
  The call_stub result buffer, BasicType, Method*, entry pointer, arguments,
  handle scope, and exception behavior must remain unchanged.
- Required evidence: generated-C proof that result locals/logging are
  return-kind-specific and no target method body or control-flow replacement is
  introduced.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://235`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://237`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10k/` did not meet the no-regression gate.
  TEST native Calc values were `138/146/139/133/138 ms` (median `138 ms`,
  worse than NPT-3h `134 ms`), and the obfusjack native repeated run timed out
  once at 180s after two completed runs. The return-kind-local source change
  was reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3l: Runtime P10 mark call_stub guard hot

- Scope: mark the generic x86-64 `neko_call_stub_guarded` wrapper as a hot
  function so the native compiler places/optimizes the mandatory bridge as hot
  code. The wrapper remains `naked`, `noinline`, and calls the same supplied
  HotSpot call_stub with the same arguments.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that only the function attribute
  changed and no owner/name/descriptor-specific method body or target selection
  behavior changed.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://243`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://245`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10l/` regressed against NPT-3h: TEST native
  Calc median `140 ms` vs `134 ms`, obfusjack native Platform `51 ms` vs
  `50 ms`, and Virtual `47 ms` vs `44 ms` while Seq remained `17 ms`. The
  `hot` attribute source change was reverted before any implementation
  checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3m: Runtime P6 primitive-array cold failure outlining

- Scope: outline only the primitive array helper failure `fprintf`/`abort`
  blocks into cold noinline helpers. Fast-path null/bounds/metadata checks,
  array load/store semantics, exception/fail-closed behavior, and generated
  target method selection must remain unchanged.
- Required evidence: generated-C proof that `neko_fast_*aload` and
  `neko_fast_*astore` hot bodies call cold failure helpers instead of carrying
  inline `fprintf` blocks.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://250`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://252`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10m/` did not meet the no-regression gate.
  TEST native Calc values were `136/141/135/143/139 ms` (median `139 ms`,
  worse than NPT-3h `134 ms`), and the obfusjack native repeated run timed out
  once at 180s after two completed runs. The primitive-array cold failure
  helper source change was reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3n: Runtime P10 remove hot NJX dispatch stats counter

- Scope: remove only the per-NJX-call diagnostic dispatch counter from the hot
  shape-specialized call_stub path. Direct invocation remains mandatory, debug
  logging still works through `NEKO_DIRECT_LOG`, resolve-failure counting
  remains available, and target Method*/entry selection is unchanged.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that shape dispatchers no longer
  call `neko_njx_note_dispatch()` while call_stub, Method*, entry pointer,
  parameter stack, result unpacking, exception checks, and handle scopes remain
  unchanged.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://260`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://262`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10n/` did not meet the no-regression gate.
  TEST native Calc values were `142/139/141/141/135 ms` (median `141 ms`,
  worse than NPT-3h `134 ms`), and the obfusjack native repeated run timed out
  once at 180s after one completed run. The dispatch-stats source change was
  reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3o: Runtime P10 localize NJX debug log gate

- Scope: keep NJX debug logging behavior but avoid repeated hot-path
  `neko_njx_debug()` loads in each shape-specialized call_stub dispatcher by
  caching the debug gate in a local and using it for the entry/exit debug log
  branches. Direct invocation, dispatch stats, resolve-failure stats, Method*,
  entry pointer, arguments, handle scopes, and exception behavior must remain
  unchanged.
- Required evidence: generated-C proof that shape dispatchers still emit the
  same debug log strings when enabled and still call the same HotSpot call_stub
  target; no owner/name/descriptor-specific method body replacement is allowed.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://268`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://270`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10o/` did not meet the no-regression gate.
  TEST native Calc values were `138/138/141/142/136 ms` (median `138 ms`,
  worse than NPT-3h `134 ms`), and the obfusjack native repeated run timed out
  once at 180s after four completed runs. The local debug-gate source change
  was reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [x] NPT-3p: Runtime P10 remove unused generic NJX dispatcher body

- Scope: delete only the generated static generic NJX dispatcher and its
  generic return-BasicType helper after source search proves registered call
  sites emit shape-specialized dispatchers. This removes dead generated C and
  must not change any Method*/entry target, call_stub bridge, argument packing,
  handle scope, exception behavior, or debug behavior on reachable paths.
- Required evidence: source search showing `neko_njx_dispatch_generic` is not
  referenced by any emitted callsite; generated C still contains the
  shape-specialized `neko_njx_*` dispatchers and no generic dispatcher body.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests and
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`. Direct parity is recorded if runtime
  paths change; this row is intended to remove unreachable code only.
- Completion criteria: fresh integration passes, generated C has no
  `neko_njx_dispatch_generic`, no forbidden JNI/JVMTI/fallback or named
  method-body substitution appears, and worktree is checkpointed.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-20: source search found no emitter callsite for
  `neko_njx_dispatch_generic`; all reachable callsites use shape-specialized
  dispatchers registered through `renderShapeCallStub`. Removed the unused
  generated generic dispatcher body and its private `neko_njx_result_basic_type`
  helper. Focused generator/audit tests passed (`artifact://280`) and fresh
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed (`artifact://282`). Generated C in
  `build/neko-native-work/run-12646002423282/` contains shape-specialized
  `neko_njx_*` dispatchers and no `neko_njx_dispatch_generic` or
  `neko_njx_result_basic_type` symbols; target Method*/entry call paths remain
  shape-specialized call_stub dispatches with no named JVM/JDK native method
  replacement.

### [x] NPT-3q: Runtime P10 remove obsolete compiled-entry trampoline generator

- Scope: delete the unused Java emitter code and generated declarations for the
  rejected compiled-entry NJX trampoline path. The retained generated runtime
  must continue to use HotSpot call_stub shape dispatchers for original JVM
  Method*/entry targets; no call target, argument packing, handle scope,
  exception behavior, or thread-state transition may change.
- Required evidence: source search proves `renderBodies()` emits
  `renderShapeCallStub` and no code references the compiled-entry generator,
  wrapper globals, or trampoline begin/end symbols after cleanup.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests and
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`.
- Completion criteria: fresh integration passes, generated C has no unused
  `g_njx_wrapper_*` or `neko_njx_tramp_*` declarations, and shape-specialized
  call_stub dispatchers remain present.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-20: removed the unused compiled-entry trampoline
  emitter, per-shape `neko_njx_tramp_*` declarations, `g_njx_wrapper_*`
  globals, and unused runtime/frame-layout helper code from
  `NativeToJavaInvokeEmitter`. Focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://287`) and fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://289`). Generated C under
  `build/neko-native-work/run-12921477179290/` contains no
  `g_njx_wrapper*`, `neko_njx_tramp_*`, or `neko_njx_runtime_t` symbols while
  retaining shape-specialized `neko_njx_*` call_stub dispatchers for the same
  Method*/entry targets.

### [rejected] NPT-3r: Runtime P12 remove unused virtual icache declared-mid argument

- Scope: remove the virtual/interface `neko_icache_dispatch` declared-method
  `jmethodID` parameter because the current generic dispatch path resolves the
  concrete target from receiver `Klass*` plus callsite name/descriptor metadata
  and never dereferences the declared id. This must not change receiver-null
  handling, exact-method resolution, Method*/entry target selection, PIC
  storage, or call_stub dispatch.
- Required evidence: source/generator proof that the parameter is used only as
  a null precondition and diagnostic value, and generated C proves callsites no
  longer bind/load a declared `jmethodID` solely for `neko_icache_dispatch`.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://296`), but fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` failed
  (`artifact://298`) in `nativeObfuscation_randomRuntimeStableTenRuns` with
  an obfusjack native timeout after 45s. The timed-out run reached only the
  platform-thread section in
  `neko-test/build/test-native/native_obfusjack_stability_9.stdout.log`, so
  the declared-`jmethodID` removal was reverted before any implementation
  checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3s: Runtime P12 outline virtual icache miss resolver

- Scope: split only the cold virtual/interface `neko_icache_dispatch` miss
  resolution block into a `cold,noinline` helper. The hot dispatch function
  must keep receiver null/meta checks, receiver `Klass*` key computation, PIC
  lookup, direct-C hits, direct-NJX hits, and the same Method*/entry/call_stub
  target path. No owner/name/descriptor-specific native implementation may be
  introduced.
- Required evidence: generated-C proof that `neko_icache_dispatch` contains
  the PIC hit path and calls `neko_icache_dispatch_miss` only after a miss,
  while the miss helper still performs the existing exact receiver method
  resolution and call_stub dispatch.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://307`) and fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://309`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10s/` failed the no-regression gate. TEST
  native Calc was `137/134/138/136/139 ms` (median `137 ms`, worse than
  NPT-3h `134 ms`), and obfusjack native was Seq `18/18/19/18/18 ms`
  (median `18 ms`, worse than `17 ms`) and Platform `53/55/55/42/52 ms`
  (median `53 ms`, worse than `50 ms`). The cold-miss outline source change
  was reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3t: Runtime P11 direct-oop handle fast-slot prediction

- Scope: add generic branch prediction only to the `neko_direct_oop_to_handle`
  active JNIHandleBlock slot availability check. The helper must still push
  the same raw oop into the same active JNIHandleBlock slot, update `_top` and
  `_last` exactly as before, allocate an overflow block only on the same
  overflow condition, and hard-abort on the same unavailable paths.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that only the generic
  `top < g_neko_jnih_block_capacity` predicate is marked as the expected fast
  path and no owner/name/descriptor-specific method replacement or handle
  semantics change is introduced.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://315`) and fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://317`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10t/` did not complete: the fifth obfusjack
  native run timed out after 180s. Completed runs did not justify retaining
  the change: TEST native Calc median was `134 ms`, but obfusjack native Seq
  completed values were `17/18/18/17 ms` and the run timed out before the
  required five-run median. The branch-prediction source change was reverted
  before any implementation checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3u: Runtime P10 no-handle NJX for static primitive shapes

- Scope: extend the existing descriptor-proven no-handle-window policy to
  native-to-Java call_stub dispatchers only for static shapes with primitive
  arguments and primitive/void returns. The dispatcher must still call the
  original Method*/entry through HotSpot call_stub, preserve JavaCallWrapper
  anchor fields, thread-state handling, exception handling, and all reference
  shapes' handle save/install/restore behavior.
- Required evidence: generated-C proof that only `S:*` shapes with no `L`
  argument and no `L` return omit `neko_handle_save`,
  `neko_njx_install_java_handles`, `neko_njx_restore_java_handles`, and
  `neko_handle_restore`; virtual, object-arg, and object-return NJX shapes must
  retain the handle frame.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://325`) and fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://327`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10u/` did not complete: the fifth obfusjack
  native run timed out after 180s. Completed TEST native Calc median was
  `134 ms`, but obfusjack native completed values were Seq `17/18/18/17 ms`,
  Platform `52/51/51/51 ms`, and Virtual `44/42/47/45 ms`; the incomplete
  obfusjack run fails the required no-regression gate. The no-handle NJX
  source change was reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3v: Runtime P10 skip empty JavaFrameAnchor copy

- Scope: optimize only generic NJX call_stub JavaFrameAnchor bookkeeping.
  When all saved JavaThread anchor slots are already null (`saved_sp`,
  `saved_pc`, and `saved_fp`), skip copying those nulls into the already
  zeroed JavaCallWrapper anchor and skip clearing the already-empty thread
  anchor. Keep the existing full JavaCallWrapper `memset`, Method*/entry
  target, call_stub invocation, parameters, result buffer, handle frame,
  thread-state transitions, exception handling, and final anchor restore.
- Required evidence: OpenJDK 21 JavaCallWrapper/JavaFrameAnchor source shows
  empty anchors are represented by null anchor slots and `clear()` writes nulls;
  generated C proves only the pre-call anchor copy/clear block is conditional
  on null slots, with no owner/name/descriptor-specific native replacement.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://338`) and fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://340`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10v/` failed the no-regression gate. TEST
  native Calc was `136/137/136/137/140 ms` (median `137 ms`, worse than
  NPT-3h `134 ms`), and obfusjack native Virtual was `47/46/48/46/40 ms`
  (median `46 ms`, worse than `44 ms`) while Seq stayed median `17 ms` and
  Platform stayed median `50 ms`. The anchor fast-path source change was
  reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3w: Runtime P10 shrink NJX stack handle block buffer

- Scope: reduce only the fixed stack reserve used for NJX call_stub's
  temporary JNIHandleBlock from 512 bytes to 384 bytes. Runtime still checks
  `stack_handles_size >= sizeof_JNIHandleBlock` before using the stack block
  and falls back to the existing heap block path when a JVM layout is larger.
  Current validation logs show the JDK 21 `JNIHandleBlock` layout is 296 bytes,
  so 384 preserves the stack path for the measured runtime while reducing each
  NJX dispatcher frame footprint. Method*/entry target selection, call_stub
  invocation, JavaCallWrapper, thread state, exception handling, and handle
  restore semantics must remain unchanged.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that only
  `__njx_handle_buf` size changed, layout logs show `blk_size=296`, and no
  owner/name/descriptor-specific native replacement is introduced.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://346`) and fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://348`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10w/` failed the no-regression gate. TEST
  native Calc stayed median `134 ms`, and obfusjack native Seq stayed median
  `17 ms`, but Platform regressed to median `52 ms` vs NPT-3h `50 ms`, and
  Virtual regressed to median `46 ms` vs `44 ms`. The 384-byte NJX stack
  handle buffer source change was reverted before any implementation
  checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3x: Runtime P10 use cached patch debug flag in handle resolver

- Scope: replace the remaining hot `getenv("NEKO_PATCH_DEBUG")` checks inside
  `neko_handle_oop` with the existing cached `NEKO_PATCH_DEBUG` macro. This
  must only change debug gating; direct-oop classification, ZGC bootstrap
  handling, local/global handle resolution, GC barriers, Method*/entry target
  selection, call_stub invocation, and exception behavior must remain
  unchanged.
- Required evidence: generated-C proof that `neko_handle_oop` no longer calls
  `getenv` on the hot handle path and still emits the same diagnostic blocks
  behind `NEKO_PATCH_DEBUG`, with no owner/name/descriptor-specific native
  replacement.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://356`), but fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` failed
  (`artifact://358`) with SIGSEGV in obfusjack runs; the debug runtime log
  wrote `hs_err_pid3307640.log` and crashed after `merged=579.0`. The handle
  debug-cache source change was reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [x] NPT-3y: Runtime P10 inline cached interpreted-entry lookup

- Scope: optimize only the generated `neko_bound_method_i_entry_ref` path used
  by static/direct and helper NJX callsites before entering HotSpot call_stub.
  After bind-time has populated the interpreted-entry slot, generated code
  should read the cached slot directly and call `neko_bound_method_i_entry`
  only on the existing null/missing-entry path. This preserves the same
  original JVM Method*/entry target and does not replace any method body.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that callsites still pass the
  same `g_mptr_*` and `g_mientry_*` slots to call_stub dispatchers, and the
  helper remains the fail-closed path for null entry slots.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: `neko_bound_method_i_entry_ref(ref)` now
  reads the cached interpreted-entry slot only when both cached `Method*` and
  interpreted-entry slots are populated; otherwise it calls the existing
  fail-closed `neko_bound_method_i_entry` helper. Focused generator/audit tests
  passed with `./gradlew :neko-test:test --rerun-tasks --tests
  dev.nekoobfuscator.test.CCodeGeneratorTest --tests
  dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest
  -Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp` (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 7s`). Fresh
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 41s`). Direct
  parity logs in `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10y/` completed five runs each
  without fatal markers: TEST original/native Calc medians `10 ms` / `87 ms`;
  obfusjack original/native medians Seq `2 ms` / `17 ms`, Platform `26 ms` /
  `43 ms`, Virtual `12 ms` / `36 ms`. Generated C in
  `build/neko-native-work/run-3262720662482/` contains the cached-entry macro in
  `neko_native_support.c` and `neko_native_impl_prelude.h`; callsites still use
  `neko_bound_method_i_entry_ref(&g_method_entry_ref_...)`; the fallback helper
  remains referenced for null slots. Executable forbidden-marker inspection
  found no `NEKO_JNI_FN_PTR`, `(*env)->`, `env->`, JNI call wrappers, array JNI
  wrappers, or JVMTI markers; remaining `FindClass`/`NewStringUTF`/`NewObject`
  strings are comments or `JVM_FindClass*` symbol names. No new `hs_err` files
  were created during this validation; newest root `hs_err_pid*.log` still
  predates the run.


### [rejected] NPT-3z: Runtime P6 primitive-array cold diagnostic outlining

- Scope: optimize only generated primitive array fast helpers by moving the
  unreachable-success-path diagnostic `fprintf`/`abort` blocks for primitive
  `xALOAD`/`xASTORE` direct-path failures into one cold, noinline, noreturn
  helper. The hot helper success checks, null/bounds semantics, primitive array
  layout reads, GC handling, and hard-abort behavior must remain unchanged.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that primitive array hot helper
  bodies call the cold helper on failure instead of embedding `fprintf`, and
  generated-C proof that no JNI/JVMTI/fallback/original-bytecode path is added.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions; same-run
  timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3y; P6 remains open for
  other hot-helper diagnostic blocks not covered by this narrow row.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-21: source changed only primitive array direct-path
  failure diagnostics into a shared cold, noinline, noreturn helper. Focused
  generator/audit tests passed and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed,
  but direct parity in `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10z/` regressed relative
  to NPT-3y: TEST native Calc median `90 ms` vs `87 ms`; obfusjack native Seq
  `18 ms` vs `17 ms`, Platform `45 ms` vs `43 ms`, and Virtual `42 ms` vs
  `36 ms`. The source change was reverted before checkpoint.


### [rejected] NPT-3aa: Runtime P7 remove CHECKCAST success-path exception check

- Scope: optimize only translated `CHECKCAST` success paths. `neko_fast_is_instance_of`
  is classified as `never_sets_pending_exception` on normal return and hard-abort
  on missing metadata; the cast-failure branch calls the existing implicit
  exception raiser and immediately jumps to `__neko_exception_exit`. Therefore
  the trailing `if (!neko_exception_check(env)) { PUSH_O(obj); }` after a
  successful cast can become `PUSH_O(obj)` without changing JVM exception
  ordering, handler selection, pending-exception visibility, or ABI behavior.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that only `CHECKCAST` success
  path checks are removed; failure paths still raise `ClassCastException` and
  jump to exception exit; no NJX, Java-calling, reflection, MethodHandle,
  direct translated call, or try/catch boundary checks are removed.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused translator/generator tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: generated C shows `CHECKCAST` success pushes directly,
  runtime and parity runs have no fatal/forbidden-marker regressions, and same-run
  timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3y.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-21: source changed only the `CHECKCAST` success
  continuation to push directly after `neko_fast_is_instance_of`; the cast
  failure branch still raised `ClassCastException` and jumped to
  `__neko_exception_exit`. Focused translator/generator tests passed and
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed, but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10aa/summary-p10aa.json` failed the no-regression
  gate relative to NPT-3y: TEST native Calc median `86 ms` vs `87 ms` improved,
  but obfusjack native Platform regressed to `45 ms` vs `43 ms` and Virtual
  regressed to `42 ms` vs `36 ms`; Seq stayed `17 ms`. The source change was
  reverted before checkpoint.

### [x] NPT-4: Compile-time post-P41 bottleneck selection

- Scope: choose the next native compile-time optimization only from the NPT-1
  fresh manifests and generated-source inspection.
- Required evidence: top compile-sum/max/wall-time rows for TEST/test21/
  SnakeGame/evaluator, generated source snippets for the dominant repeated
  generic code shape, rejected-shape comparison against P27/P29/P33/P34/P36/P37/
  P40, and a proof that the proposed change is source-shape or build-architecture
  generic rather than fixture-specific.
- Validation command or runtime target: read-only inspection of NPT-1 artifacts;
  no implementation in this row.
- Completion criteria: one concrete compile-time implementation row is added to
  `.plan/native-compile-parallelization-2026-05-17.md` with scope, required
  evidence, validation commands, and completion criteria before code changes.
- Dependency: NPT-1.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: selected `.plan/native-compile-parallelization-2026-05-17.md`
  P42 from the fresh NPT-1 post-P41 baseline. The baseline summary shows TEST
  compile sum/max `25439ms/1216ms`, obfusjack `41138ms/2053ms`, SnakeGame
  `9816ms/770ms`, and evaluator `45750ms/1629ms`. Source inspection of the
  top generated impl files found exact `if (!neko_exception_check(env)) {`
  continuation guards still widespread after P41: TEST `77`, obfusjack `301`
  with `82` in `neko_native_impl_39.c`, SnakeGame `61`, and evaluator `239`.
  Larger top-file repeated shapes were rejected by prior rows and are not
  selected: P33 string literal descriptors, P40 current-owner class macro,
  P36 method-pointer macro, P29 static setter refs, P37 fieldID elision, P27
  nested primitive-store fusion, and P34 helper shard rebalancing. P42 records
  a source-shape-only macro compaction target that preserves every exception
  check and does not implement the rejected P7/NPT-3aa check-removal route.

### [rejected] NPT-5: Implement the first post-P41 compile-time optimization row

- Scope: implement only the concrete row selected by NPT-4, preserving Zig,
  `-O3`, current target flags, native coverage, no-JNI/no-JVMTI policy, and
  runtime semantics unless the selected row explicitly proves an equivalent
  behavior-preserving code-shape change.
- Required evidence: the selected row in
  `.plan/native-compile-parallelization-2026-05-17.md`, focused tests covering
  the generated source contract, fresh manifests, direct runtime output, and
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/unit tests,
  generated-C hot-path audit, fresh native-only TEST/test21/SnakeGame/evaluator
  generation, direct runtime smoke, timing comparison against NPT-1, newest
  `hs_err` scan, and forbidden-marker scan.
- Completion criteria: at least one build-size/top-tail/wall-time metric improves
  without runtime regression, all fresh artifacts report `translated>0
  rejected=0`, and no rejected prior shape or fallback mechanism is reintroduced.
- Dependency: NPT-4.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-21: selected compile-time row P42 was implemented
  and fully validated but rejected. Focused Gradle tests passed, fresh
  native-only generation under `build/p42-native-validation/` reported
  TEST/obfusjack/SnakeGame/evaluator translated/rejected rows `49/0`, `93/0`,
  `18/0`, and `122/0`, direct runtime was clean with no fresh `hs_err`, and
  generated-C inspection found `NEKO_IF_NO_EXCEPTION(env)` at rewritten sites
  with old exact continuation guards at `0`. The row failed completion because
  compile metrics were mixed and obfusjack no-debug runtime repeats regressed
  versus NPT-3y. P42 source/test changes were reverted before checkpoint; a new
  compile-time selection row is required before another implementation attempt.

### [x] NPT-5a: Select the next post-P42 compile-time optimization row

- Scope: choose the next native compile-time optimization from fresh post-P41/
  post-P42 evidence without retrying the rejected P42 macro-only guard shape or
  any previously rejected body/runtime shape.
- Required evidence: generated prelude/header sizes, implementation include
  counts, per-source compile tails from NPT-1/P42 artifacts, read-only
  generated-source inspection identifying the repeated generic declaration
  surface, and explicit rejection-boundary comparison against P27/P29/P33/P34/
  P36/P37/P40/P42 and NPT-3aa.
- Validation command or runtime target: read-only artifact/source inspection; no
  Gradle or runtime command for the selection row.
- Completion criteria: the owning compile plan records one concrete P43 row with
  scope, required evidence, validation commands, completion criteria, and a
  dependency/order reason before implementation starts.
- Dependency reason: NPT-2 and runtime rows remain open, but this selected row
  changes only generated source packaging/declaration inclusion for compile-time
  work. It must not alter runtime helper behavior or translated statement
  bodies, and the implementation row remains blocked on fresh runtime smoke
  validation before acceptance.
- Selection evidence 2026-05-21: selected
  `.plan/native-compile-parallelization-2026-05-17.md` P43. Read-only
  inspection found the canonical generated implementation prelude is included by
  almost every implementation file and is large in the NPT-1 artifacts: TEST
  about `353094` bytes/`6768` lines, obfusjack `410699` bytes/`7970` lines,
  SnakeGame `293653` bytes/`5569` lines, and evaluator `388879` bytes/`7251`
  lines. Obfusjack's hot `neko_native_impl_39.c` includes the full prelude but
  uses only subsets of numbered method-entry refs, method-id refs, field refs,
  class refs, inline-cache site macros, and method-pointer globals. P43 targets
  per-implementation sliced contract headers and explicitly does not change
  translated bodies, exception checks, strings, current-owner binding,
  method-pointer operands, static setters, field binding semantics, nested
  stores, or helper shard size.

### [x] NPT-5b: Implement P43 sliced implementation contract headers

- Scope: implement only P43's source-packaging change: generate per-impl sliced
  prelude headers for translated implementation sources while retaining the
  canonical full `neko_native_impl_prelude.h` for support/late-support shards.
- Required evidence: focused source-set tests, generated manifest/header-size
  data, fresh native-only TEST/obfusjack/SnakeGame/evaluator generation,
  generated-C inspection proving implementation body text is unchanged except
  include filenames and sufficient referenced declarations are present, direct
  runtime output, forbidden-marker scan, and newest `hs_err` scan.
- Validation command or runtime target: after explicit permission for
  repository `./gradlew`, run focused `CCodeGeneratorTest` and
  `NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest`, then fresh native-only generation with
  `.plan/native-only-full.yml`, direct TEST/obfusjack/evaluator/SnakeGame smoke
  with `-Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp`, manifest/header comparison, and
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: refreshed artifacts report `translated>0 rejected=0`;
  compile/link succeeds without fallback; per-impl header parse volume and at
  least one build tail/compile-sum/wall-time metric improves or remains within
  noise with no runtime regression; support shards still use the canonical full
  contract; no runtime semantics, compiler flags, native coverage, JNI/JVMTI
  fallback, skip-on-error behavior, original-bytecode fallback, or stale proof
  is introduced.
- Dependency: NPT-5a and P43.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: P43 is implemented and validated. The code
  now emits `neko_native_impl_N_prelude.h` for implementation sources and keeps
  `neko_native_impl_prelude.h` for support shards. A dependency-closure fix was
  added after focused audit exposed a generic sliced-macro dependency failure:
  retained `neko_concat_accumulate_string` needed `g_off_*` externs even though
  the implementation body referenced only the macro. Focused Gradle validation
  passed:
  `./gradlew :neko-test:test --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.CCodeGeneratorTest --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest -Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp`.
  Fresh native-only generation under `build/p43-native-validation/` produced
  TEST/obfusjack/SnakeGame/evaluator translated/rejected rows `49/0`, `93/0`,
  `18/0`, and `122/0`. Fresh run dirs
  `build/neko-native-work/run-8052435246015`,
  `run-8067151202699`, `run-8077119367912`, and
  `run-8091067486053` recorded generated C counts `67`, `113`, `34`, and
  `143`, and implementation header counts/sliced counts `50/49`, `94/93`,
  `19/18`, and `123/122`. Representative sliced headers are materially smaller
  than the full contract: TEST impl0 `299509` vs `356323` bytes, obfusjack
  impl39 `333519` vs `416657`, SnakeGame impl0 `275269` vs `295686`, evaluator
  impl104 `298320` vs `393898`. Direct runtime smoke with
  `-XX:+PerfDisableSharedMem -Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp` passed for
  TEST, obfusjack, and evaluator; SnakeGame preserved the expected headless GUI
  exception. Forbidden-marker inspection found no executable JNI/JVMTI/fallback
  markers in the fresh generated C/header/property set, and no fresh
  `hs_err_pid*.log` appeared in the validation build/runtime directories.

### [ ] NPT-6: Sync final validation plans after the first accepted optimization

- Scope: update `.plan/native-full-validation.md`, `.plan/native-full-repair.md`,
  and the owning runtime/compile-time source plan with the fresh evidence from
  the first accepted implementation row.
- Required evidence: commands, exit codes, output paths, generated C/native
  inspection, runtime outputs, timing rows, and rejection criteria status.
- Validation command or runtime target: no new runtime command beyond the owning
  row; this is an audit-sync row.
- Completion criteria: no stale checkbox is marked complete; every updated
  checkbox has a matching fresh artifact and evidence path.

### [x] NPT-3ab: Runtime P12 virtual/interface PIC-hit audit

- Scope: add only default-off diagnostic counters for the existing
  `neko_icache_dispatch` virtual/interface PIC path. The audit may count
  direct-C hits, direct-NJX hits, misses, translated-stub stores, direct-NJX
  stores, and unresolved exits in the existing `NEKO_DIRECT_DEBUG=1` stats
  summary.
- Required evidence: current source shows direct-C and direct-NJX hit branches,
  interleaved miss resolution, and only a per-site `miss_count`; previous P12
  declared-mid removal and cold-miss outlining were rejected. The new audit must
  prove the current hit/miss/target-kind mix before any further dispatch shape
  change.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests with
  repository `./gradlew` after permission, fresh
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, default-off TEST/obfusjack parity runs,
  one opt-in `NEKO_DIRECT_DEBUG=1` diagnostic runtime, and generated-C
  inspection.
- Completion criteria: generated C shows only audit counters/logging added
  around existing branches; default-off parity has no accepted regression; the
  opt-in diagnostic run emits useful PIC hit/miss/target-kind counts; no
  receiver-key computation, PIC size, target selection, miss resolution,
  direct-C dispatch, direct-NJX call-stub dispatch, handle scope, exception
  behavior, JNI/JVMTI fallback, skip-on-error behavior, or original-bytecode
  fallback changes.
- Completion evidence: focused `CCodeGeneratorTest` and
  `NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest` passed; fresh
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed; opt-in TEST audit artifact
  `build/p12-icache-audit/TEST-native-audit.jar` generated with
  `translated=49 rejected=0` from
  `build/neko-native-work/run-9527959662306`; its build manifest recorded
  `icache.audit.build=true` and compile commands containing
  `-DNEKO_ICACHE_AUDIT=1`. The opt-in `NEKO_DIRECT_DEBUG=1` runtime completed
  and emitted counters including `icache_direct_njx_hit=519999`,
  `icache_miss=43`, `icache_direct_njx_store=44`, `resolve_failed=0`, and
  `icache_unresolved=0`; a second loaded native segment reported
  `icache_direct_njx_hit=20`, `icache_miss=76`, `icache_direct_njx_store=77`,
  `resolve_failed=0`, `icache_unresolved=0`. Generated-C inspection found no
  executable forbidden JNI/JVMTI markers in the icache support path; remaining
  support-file JNI strings were comments or internal JVM symbol names.
- Outcome: the audit is accepted as measurement infrastructure. The recorded
  runtime mix is dominated by direct-NJX PIC hits, so no further P12 cold-miss
  outlining or dispatch-shape change is justified without new evidence.
- Dependency update: P2/P4 GC strict acceptance remains blocked by the fresh
  ZGC mask-publication abort (`ZGC oop load masks unavailable addr=0x0
  good=0x0`). This P12 row is measurement-only runtime hot-path debugging to
  guide the next performance change; it does not mark any GC blocker complete.

### [-] NPT-3ac: Runtime P13 raw-function flattening validation

- Scope: validate the existing structural raw-function flattening heuristic in
  `CCodeGenerator` without changing runtime code. The current source emits
  `NEKO_FLATTEN NEKO_HOT` only for translated raw bodies whose statement count
  is at or below `MAX_FLATTEN_STATEMENTS`, and emits `NEKO_HOT` without
  `NEKO_FLATTEN` for larger translated bodies.
- Required evidence: source line evidence for `MAX_FLATTEN_STATEMENTS`,
  `isLargeImplementation`, and conditional raw-function emission; fresh
  generated-C evidence showing both flattened and non-flattened translated
  bodies selected by statement count; runtime/performance evidence that the
  current source does not regress the accepted baseline.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests with
  repository `./gradlew` after permission, fresh TEST/obfusjack native
  generation and runtime, generated-C inspection, and performance capture.
- Completion criteria: no owner/name/descriptor/sample-specific selection,
  no CFF block change, no bytecode translation change, no JNI/JVMTI fallback,
  no skip/original-bytecode fallback, and no accepted runtime/performance
  regression.
- Rejected validation 2026-05-21: the structural heuristic is generic and was
  present in source, but this row is not accepted as a performance win. Source
  evidence: `CCodeGenerator.MAX_FLATTEN_STATEMENTS = 128`,
  `fn.body().size() > MAX_FLATTEN_STATEMENTS`, and conditional raw emission at
  `CCodeGenerator.java:2150-2157`. Fresh TEST native generation translated
  `49` methods with `rejected=0`; generated C showed large
  `neko_native_impl_0.c` emitted as `NEKO_HOT` without `NEKO_FLATTEN` while
  small bodies such as `neko_native_impl_8.c` kept
  `NEKO_FLATTEN NEKO_HOT`. Fresh obfusjack native generation translated `93`
  methods with `rejected=0`; generated C showed large bodies
  `neko_native_impl_39.c` (`1085` lines), `neko_native_impl_44.c` (`181`
  lines), and `neko_native_impl_46.c` (`146` lines) emitted as `NEKO_HOT`
  without `NEKO_FLATTEN`, while small bodies such as `neko_native_impl_13.c`
  (`38` lines) and `neko_native_impl_0.c` (`30` lines) kept
  `NEKO_FLATTEN NEKO_HOT`. Runtime evidence: TEST native completed five fresh
  runs with Calc `86/90/85/90/83 ms`, median `86 ms`, which is below the
  accepted NPT-3y TEST median `87 ms`. Obfusjack native completed fresh runs
  with Platform `45/48/50/45/45 ms`, Virtual `47/37/39/48/43 ms`, and Seq
  `17/19/17/17/17 ms`; medians were Platform `45 ms`, Virtual `43 ms`, and
  Seq `17 ms`. One 120s run timed out after printing `=== All tests completed
  ===`; a 180s rerun exited `0` with Platform `44 ms`, Virtual `42 ms`, and
  Seq `18 ms`, so no crash/fatal/JNI fallback was observed. The row remains
  rejected because obfusjack Platform and Virtual regressed versus the accepted
  baseline and missed the performance gate (`Platform <= 44 ms`,
  `Virtual <= 35 ms`, `Seq <= 14 ms`). Do not change the flattening threshold
  or selection shape without new generated-code and compiler-layout evidence.

### [x] NPT-3ad: Runtime P14 opt-in native compiler diagnostics

- Scope: add only an optional native compiler diagnostics mode controlled by
  `NEKO_NATIVE_OPT_DIAGNOSTICS=1`. The mode may add clang/zig optimization
  record flags and manifest entries for per-source diagnostic files.
- Required evidence: `NativeBuildEngine` currently records debug and icache
  audit build flags and assembles common compile flags, but has no
  optimization-diagnostics flag or per-source diagnostics manifest paths.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused Gradle tests with repository
  `./gradlew` after permission, one normal native generation proving default
  compile commands are unchanged and diagnostics disabled, one opt-in native
  generation proving diagnostics enabled in the manifest/compile commands and
  producing inspectable compiler diagnostics or optimization-record files, plus
  generated-C forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: default builds do not include diagnostics flags and do
  not change generated C, translated bytecode, runtime dispatch, JNI/JVMTI
  behavior, fallback behavior, or release compile/link flags; opt-in builds
  expose enough compiler output to guide P4/P6/P8/P13 without making
  diagnostics mandatory for normal artifacts.
- Completion evidence: focused `CCodeGeneratorTest` and
  `NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest` passed. Normal TEST generation
  `build/neko-native-work/run-9988143205398` produced `translated=49
  rejected=0`, manifest `opt.diagnostics.build=false`, and no
  `-fsave-optimization-record` or `-foptimization-record-file` compile flags.
  The first opt-in attempt rejected unsupported
  `-foptimization-record-format=yaml`; the accepted narrowed implementation
  generated `build/p14-opt-diagnostics/TEST-native-opt-diagnostics.jar` from
  `build/neko-native-work/run-10032888234072` with `translated=49 rejected=0`,
  manifest `opt.diagnostics.build=true`, compile commands containing
  `-fsave-optimization-record` and per-source `-foptimization-record-file=...`,
  and 67 `.opt.yaml` files under `opt-diagnostics/linux_x64`. Representative
  `neko_native_impl_0.opt.yaml` records inline pass diagnostics such as
  `AlwaysInline`. The opt-in TEST jar ran successfully with `Calc: 83ms`.
  Generated-C inspection found no executable forbidden JNI/JVMTI/fallback
  markers in the checked support/icache paths; remaining support-file JNI
  strings were comments or internal JVM symbol names.
- Outcome: P14 is accepted as opt-in compiler evidence infrastructure. It is
  not itself a runtime optimization, but it gives the next P13/P4 work a
  concrete inlining/optimization record without perturbing normal artifacts.

### [x] NPT-3ae: Runtime ZGC barrier readiness capability invariant

- Scope: fix only the ZGC GC-barrier readiness predicate so readiness means
  translated oop load/store paths have an executable ZGC barrier capability.
  The change must not add JNI fallback, skip behavior, original-bytecode
  fallback, sample-derived ZGC masks, owner/name/descriptor selection, or any
  new Java helper.
- Required evidence: fresh strict ZGC logs show `ZGlobalsForVMStructs`
  metadata is discovered, but the published values are all zero and `z_lrb`,
  `z_array`, and `z_store` are all `(nil)` while the current runtime still
  reports `gc barrier: ready=1 kind=3`. Runtime then aborts later with
  `ZGC oop load masks unavailable addr=0x0 good=0x0`. Source evidence:
  `neko_gc_barrier_layout_ready` treats ZGC instance pointer plus offsets as
  ready even when no callable runtime barrier and no nonzero live masks are
  available.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests with the
  repository `./gradlew` after permission, fresh TEST native generation,
  strict ZGC TEST runtime probe with patch logging, and generated-C/log
  inspection.
- Completion criteria: ZGC readiness is capability-based: either callable ZGC
  runtime/CompilerToVM barriers are present, or the inline path has nonzero
  live masks sufficient for translated oop loads. If neither capability is
  present, the runtime fails closed before selecting translated oop paths and
  does not reach a later missing-mask abort, JNI fallback, skip, or original
  bytecode fallback.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: focused `CCodeGeneratorTest` and
  `NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest` passed. Fresh TEST native generation
  produced `build/npt-3ae-zgc/TEST-native.jar` from
  `build/neko-native-work/run-10986264548170` with `translated=49 rejected=0`
  and `libneko_linux_x64.so` size `1088536` bytes. Generated C contains the
  new capability predicate in `neko_native_support_helpers_2.c`: it reads
  live/frozen ZGC address, load-good, load-bad, store-good, and store-bad masks
  and requires all five to be nonzero before accepting the inline VMStruct
  path. Strict ZGC TEST with `NEKO_PATCH_DEBUG=1 -XX:+UseZGC
  -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+ZVerifyViews` aborted at layout
  initialization with `gc barrier: ready=0 kind=3` and
  `gc barrier path not ready for kind=3`; the previous later
  `ZGC oop load masks unavailable addr=0x0 good=0x0` abort did not appear.
  The same generated TEST native jar completed under the default collector with
  `Calc: 89ms`. The row is accepted as a fail-closed capability-invariant fix;
  P2/P4 GC strict completion still requires a real callable ZGC barrier or
  nonzero-mask capability on this JDK.

### [x] NPT-3af: Runtime ZGC CompilerToVM and long-constant capability audit

- Scope: add only generic, default-off patch-debug evidence collection for
  HotSpot-published ZGC capability sources that are not currently audited:
  `gHotSpotVMLongConstants`, `CompilerToVM::Data` Z barrier fields, and
  thread-local ZGC mask offsets such as `thread_address_bad_mask_offset`.
  This row must not call CodeBlob runtime stubs, select a new ZGC barrier path,
  derive sample masks, add JNI/JVMTI/helper fallback, or alter translated
  runtime behavior outside opt-in diagnostics.
- Required evidence: post-NPT-3ae strict ZGC TEST fails closed at native layout
  initialization with `gc barrier: ready=0 kind=3`; local `libjvm.so` strings
  contain `thread_address_bad_mask_offset` and `ZBarrierSetRuntime_*` names,
  while `nm -D` does not expose matching dynamic symbols. Current source walks
  `gHotSpotVMStructs`, `gHotSpotVMTypes`, and `gHotSpotVMIntConstants`, but
  has no `gHotSpotVMLongConstants` walker and current patch-debug logs do not
  prove whether CompilerToVM or long-constant entries are reachable.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests with the
  repository `./gradlew` after permission, fresh TEST native generation,
  strict ZGC TEST runtime probe with `NEKO_PATCH_DEBUG=1`, and generated-C/log
  inspection.
- Completion criteria: fresh logs either prove a generic, HotSpot-published,
  ABI-safe source for ZGC masks/barriers exists and identify its exact service
  table path, or prove that this JDK does not expose such a source through the
  runtime's permitted VMStructs/VMTypes/VMIntConstants/VMLongConstants/dlsym
  paths. The runtime must still fail closed under ZGC until a later row records
  complete ABI evidence and implements an executable barrier capability.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: focused `CCodeGeneratorTest` and
  `NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest` passed after adding the diagnostics.
  Fresh TEST native generation produced `build/npt-3af-zgc/TEST-native.jar`
  from `build/neko-native-work/run-11515458382165` with `translated=49
  rejected=0` and `libneko_linux_x64.so` size `1090200` bytes. Generated C
  contains the new `neko_walk_vm_long_constants` audit and VMStruct/VMInt
  zcap summaries. Strict ZGC TEST with `NEKO_PATCH_DEBUG=1 -XX:+UseZGC
  -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+ZVerifyViews` still failed closed at
  native layout initialization with `gc barrier: ready=0 kind=3`. The fresh
  stderr log shows standard VMStructs expose only 11 `ZGlobalsForVMStructs`
  zcap entries and `compilertovm_zcap_matches=0`; VMIntConstants expose
  `vmint zcap matches=0`; VMLongConstants expose only four zero-valued
  `ZAddress*` constants. The same jar completed under the default collector
  with `Calc: 92ms`. Independent local OpenJDK source inspection found the
  missing `CompilerToVM::Data` Z barrier entries and
  `thread_address_bad_mask_offset` in JVMCI VMStruct tables
  (`jvmciHotSpotVMStructs` / `jvmciHotSpotVMIntConstants` /
  `jvmciHotSpotVMLongConstants`), so the next implementation row must add a
  generic JVMCI serviceability-table walker before selecting any ZGC barrier
  capability.

### [x] NPT-3ag: Runtime JVMCI serviceability-table ZGC binding

- Scope: add a generic native walker for the JVMCI HotSpot serviceability
  tables that are already exported by libjvm on JVMCI-capable builds:
  `jvmciHotSpotVMStructs`, `jvmciHotSpotVMIntConstants`, and
  `jvmciHotSpotVMLongConstants`. Bind only the ZGC-relevant
  `CompilerToVM::Data` entries that the local OpenJDK source publishes and
  whose ABI already matches the runtime call surface:
  `thread_address_bad_mask_offset` and
  `ZBarrierSetRuntime_load_barrier_on_oop_field_preloaded`. Audit, but do not
  publish as callable, `ZBarrierSetRuntime_load_barrier_on_oop_array` because
  local OpenJDK source shows its ABI is `void(oop*, size_t)` while the current
  runtime typedef is still `void*(void*)`. This row must not treat the
  C1 CodeBlob runtime stubs as callable C ABI functions, must not derive
  sample masks, and must not mark ZGC ready until store/no-store semantics are
  recorded and proven by a later row.
- Required evidence: NPT-3af fresh logs prove the standard
  `gHotSpotVMStructs`/VMInt/VMLong tables do not expose CompilerToVM ZGC
  capability entries on this JDK. Local OpenJDK source shows JVMCI exports
  `jvmciHotSpotVMStructs`, `jvmciHotSpotVMIntConstants`, and
  `jvmciHotSpotVMLongConstants`; `vmStructs_jvmci.cpp` lists
  `CompilerToVM::Data::thread_address_bad_mask_offset`,
  `ZBarrierSetRuntime_load_barrier_on_oop_field_preloaded`, and
  `ZBarrierSetRuntime_load_barrier_on_oop_array`; `XBarrierSetRuntime.hpp`
  proves the field-load ABI matches the current two-argument runtime typedef,
  while the array ABI does not match yet; and
  `jvmciCompilerToVMInit.cpp` initializes those fields under `UseZGC` from
  `XThreadLocalData::address_bad_mask_offset()` and
  `XBarrierSetRuntime::*_addr()`.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests with the
  repository `./gradlew` after permission, fresh TEST native generation,
  strict ZGC TEST runtime probe with `NEKO_PATCH_DEBUG=1`, generated-C/log
  inspection, and default collector TEST smoke.
- Completion criteria: generated C contains a JVMCI-table walker that uses the
  same VMStruct entry layout offsets as the standard table, fresh strict-ZGC
  logs show whether the JVMCI table is present and whether the expected
  CompilerToVM entries bind or are deliberately left unbound for ABI reasons,
  and the runtime still fails closed unless a complete ZGC barrier capability
  is proven. No JNI fallback,
  JVMTI, original bytecode, skip behavior, or benchmark/sample-specific logic
  may be introduced.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: focused `CCodeGeneratorTest` and
  `NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest` passed after adding the JVMCI walkers.
  Fresh TEST native generation produced `build/npt-3ag-zgc/TEST-native.jar`
  from `build/neko-native-work/run-12028033311558` with `translated=49
  rejected=0` and `libneko_linux_x64.so` size `1093336` bytes. Generated C
  contains `neko_walk_jvmci_vm_structs`, `neko_walk_jvmci_vm_constants`, the
  `z_bad_off` GC-barrier diagnostic, and the corrected
  `off_zglobals_pointer_store_bad_mask = -1` initialization. Strict ZGC TEST
  with patch logging failed closed at layout initialization in both default
  JVMCI state and with `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+EnableJVMCI`;
  both fresh logs report `jvmci vmstructs unavailable: table=(nil)`,
  `jvmci vmint constants unavailable: table=(nil)`, and
  `jvmci vmlong constants unavailable: table=(nil)`, then
  `gc barrier: ready=0 kind=3 ... z_lrb=(nil) z_array=(nil) z_store=(nil)
  z_bad_off=-1`. ELF inspection of the active
  `/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk/lib/server/libjvm.so` shows no dynamic or
  regular symbols for `jvmciHotSpotVMStructs`, while `strings` still contains
  the names `thread_address_bad_mask_offset` and
  `ZBarrierSetRuntime_load_barrier_on_oop_*`. The same jar completed under the
  default collector with `Calc: 94ms`. The row is accepted as a generic
  dlsym-reachable JVMCI-table audit/binder; this runtime does not expose the
  table, so ZGC strict remains fail-closed.

### [x] NPT-3ah: Runtime stripped JVMCI serviceability-table recovery audit

- Scope: determine whether the active product `libjvm.so` contains a
  recoverable JVMCI VMStructEntry table despite stripping the exported
  `jvmciHotSpotVM*` symbols. This is a read-only audit/prototype row only:
  inspect ELF sections, local OpenJDK layout, and runtime logs; do not add a
  runtime scanner, do not scan arbitrary heap/code memory, do not select a ZGC
  barrier path, and do not change executable behavior until a complete generic
  invariant is recorded.
- Required evidence: NPT-3ag shows `dlsym` cannot resolve
  `jvmciHotSpotVMStructs`, `jvmciHotSpotVMIntConstants`, or
  `jvmciHotSpotVMLongConstants` even with `-XX:+EnableJVMCI`; `nm` and
  `readelf -Ws` show no matching symbols in the active Arch OpenJDK
  `libjvm.so`; `strings` still contains
  `thread_address_bad_mask_offset` and `ZBarrierSetRuntime_load_barrier_on_oop_*`;
  local OpenJDK source defines VMStructEntry layout and the JVMCI table fields.
- Validation command or runtime target: read-only local source and ELF
  inspection, plus optional repository-local prototype output under `build/`
  if needed. No Gradle or runtime artifact is required unless the audit
  becomes an implementation row.
- Completion criteria: either identify a generic, bounded, section-scoped way
  to recover JVMCI VMStructEntry records from the mapped `libjvm.so` image with
  enough evidence for a later implementation row, or record that the product
  JDK does not expose a safe recoverable JVMCI table path and choose the next
  non-ZGC performance/GC blocker.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: read-only ELF/source inspection identified a
  bounded recovery path. `readelf -S` shows the active
  `/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk/lib/server/libjvm.so` contains `.rodata`,
  `.data.rel.ro`, and `.data` sections; `.symtab` is absent and `readelf -Ws`
  shows no `jvmciHotSpotVM*` symbols. `grep -aob` found
  `CompilerToVM::Data` at file/VMA `0xf4c22a`,
  `thread_address_bad_mask_offset` at `0xfb1eb8`,
  `ZBarrierSetRuntime_load_barrier_on_oop_field_preloaded` at `0xfb1ed8`,
  and `ZBarrierSetRuntime_load_barrier_on_oop_array` at `0xfb2060`. A
  read-only prototype search for little-endian pointer addends found
  VMStructEntry-shaped records in the data image: entry `0x12f0930` points to
  `CompilerToVM::Data`, `thread_address_bad_mask_offset`, type string `int`,
  `isStatic=1`, and static-address addend `0x1314db0`; entry `0x12f0960`
  points to `ZBarrierSetRuntime_load_barrier_on_oop_field_preloaded`, type
  string `address`, and static-address addend `0x1314da8`; entry `0x12f0a80`
  points to `ZBarrierSetRuntime_load_barrier_on_oop_array`, type string
  `address`, and static-address addend `0x1314d78`. Local OpenJDK source
  confirms the VMStructEntry layout is six fields / 48 bytes and the JVMCI
  table emits sentinel-terminated arrays. The next implementation row may add
  a generic libjvm image-section scanner limited to the mapped libjvm
  data/RELRO ranges and these VMStructEntry invariants; it must still keep the
  array barrier unbound until its ABI is corrected.

### [x] NPT-3ai: Runtime stripped JVMCI VMStructEntry scanner

- Scope: implement a generic, bounded native scanner that recovers only
  stripped JVMCI `CompilerToVM::Data` VMStructEntry records from mapped
  `libjvm.so` data/RELRO ranges when the `jvmciHotSpotVM*` export symbols are
  unavailable. VMStructEntry scanning must stay limited to path-tagged
  `libjvm.so` non-executable mappings; VMStruct static slots may additionally
  validate against immediately adjacent anonymous writable data mappings
  created by the loader for `libjvm.so` data. The scanner may bind
  `thread_address_bad_mask_offset` and
  `ZBarrierSetRuntime_load_barrier_on_oop_field_preloaded` if their entries
  satisfy the exact VMStructEntry invariant. It must audit but not publish
  `ZBarrierSetRuntime_load_barrier_on_oop_array` until the array ABI row fixes
  the runtime call surface. It must not scan arbitrary process memory, treat
  raw CodeBlob stubs as C ABI calls, derive sample masks, mark ZGC ready, or
  change store/no-store semantics.
- Required evidence: NPT-3ah proves the active stripped `libjvm.so` contains
  VMStructEntry-shaped records in the data image pointing to the exact
  `CompilerToVM::Data` and ZGC field strings, and local OpenJDK source proves
  the entry layout and field ABI for the field-load barrier. NPT-3ag proves
  dlsym-exported JVMCI tables are unavailable at runtime.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests with the
  repository `./gradlew` after permission, fresh TEST native generation,
  strict ZGC TEST runtime probe with `NEKO_PATCH_DEBUG=1`, generated-C/log
  inspection, and default collector TEST smoke.
- Completion criteria: generated C contains a scanner bounded to mapped
  `libjvm.so` non-executable data/RELRO ranges, adjacent loader-created
  anonymous libjvm data slots, and exact VMStructEntry pointer invariants; fresh
  strict-ZGC logs show the scanner either binds
  `thread_address_bad_mask_offset` and the field-load barrier or proves the
  entries were not recoverable; the array barrier remains unbound with an ABI
  diagnostic; ZGC readiness remains fail-closed until a later complete barrier
  row.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: focused generator/audit tests passed. Fresh
  TEST native generation produced
  `build/npt-3ai-zgc/TEST-native.jar` from
  `build/neko-native-work/run-13077085932357` with `translated=49 rejected=0`.
  Strict ZGC TEST with `NEKO_PATCH_DEBUG=1` found bounded libjvm scan, slot,
  and executable ranges, including adjacent anonymous slot ranges, recovered the exact
  `CompilerToVM::Data` VMStructEntry records, bound
  `thread_address_bad_mask_offset` from slot `0x7f2d12b14db0` with value `0`,
  observed a null field-load barrier slot, audited executable target validation
  for future non-null field barrier slots, audited the array barrier as
  not-bound due to the current ABI mismatch, and failed closed with
  `gc barrier: ready=0 kind=3`. Generated-C inspection shows the scanner is
  emitted in `neko_native_support.c` and the bootstrap call is emitted in
  `neko_native_support_helpers_3.c`. Default collector TEST completed with
  `Calc: 91ms`.

### [x] NPT-3aj: JVMCI ZGC barrier slot initialization audit

- Scope: determine why the recovered stripped JVMCI
  `ZBarrierSetRuntime_load_barrier_on_oop_field_preloaded` static slot is null
  during strict ZGC native layout initialization even though the
  `CompilerToVM::Data` VMStructEntry record and slot address are recoverable.
  This is a read-only evidence row. It may inspect OpenJDK source, local
  `libjvm.so` symbols/strings, generated native logs, and existing generated C,
  but must not call JVMCI initialization paths, bind raw CodeBlob stubs, mark
  ZGC ready, change store/no-store semantics, or add fallback behavior.
- Required evidence: NPT-3ai proves the VMStructEntry scanner recovers the
  bad-mask static slot and the field-load barrier static slot, but fresh strict
  ZGC logs show the field-load barrier slot value is null while the GC barrier
  path remains fail-closed.
- Validation command or runtime target: source/symbol/log audit only; if a
  candidate runtime path is found, record a later implementation row with its
  exact invariant and runtime validation target before editing executable code.
- Completion criteria: identify the exact initializer or runtime publication
  path responsible for filling the JVMCI ZGC barrier slots, prove whether it is
  callable or observable from the current native bootstrap surface without JNI
  fallback/JVMTI/new helper layers, and record the next generic implementation
  or rejection decision.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: OpenJDK source shows
  `CompilerToVM::Data::initialize(JVMCI_TRAPS)` publishes the ZGC slots from
  `XBarrierSetRuntime::*_addr()` under `UseZGC`; the initializer is invoked
  from `readConfiguration0`, which is reached through JVMCI Java/native
  configuration paths, not from the VMStruct table walk itself. The native
  JVMCI runtime entry `JVM_GetJVMCIRuntime` rejects calls unless `EnableJVMCI`
  is set and initializes the Java `HotSpotJVMCIRuntime`; this path requires the
  JVMCI/JNI Java runtime surface and is not a valid native-bootstrap trigger
  under the no-JNI/no-new-helper constraints. Runtime evidence confirms the
  timing: default strict ZGC keeps the recovered field-load and array slots
  null, while strict ZGC with
  `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+EnableJVMCI -XX:+EagerJVMCI` fills
  `thread_address_bad_mask_offset=40`,
  `ZBarrierSetRuntime_load_barrier_on_oop_field_preloaded=0x7f398144ace0`,
  and `ZBarrierSetRuntime_load_barrier_on_oop_array=0x7f398144ab70`.
  Readiness still fails closed because the current native surface intentionally
  does not bind the mismatched array ABI and has no resolved store barrier.
  Next implementation must be a separate row: correct and bind the ZGC array
  ABI from the recovered JVMCI slot, then reassess ZGC readiness around the
  actually available callable barriers and inline fail-closed store path.

### [x] NPT-3ak: ZGC C1 barrier stub target recovery audit

- Scope: determine whether the named ZGC C1 barrier CodeBlobs present in the
  CodeCache can provide a generic, architecture-level recovery path to the
  underlying callable runtime leaf functions when `libjvm.so` symbols are
  stripped and JVMCI `CompilerToVM::Data` slots have not been initialized. This
  is a read-only evidence row. It may inspect OpenJDK C1/ZGC source, current
  generated logs, generated C, and static binary metadata. It must not bind raw
  CodeBlob stubs, execute recovered targets, infer addresses from sample
  benchmarks, mark ZGC ready, or add executable behavior.
- Required evidence: NPT-3aj proves default strict ZGC does not publish the
  JVMCI barrier slot values during early native layout initialization, while
  fresh logs show named `load_barrier_on_oop_field_preloaded_runtime_stub`
  CodeBlobs exist even in the default strict-ZGC run.
- Validation command or runtime target: source/log/static audit only. If a
  target-recovery invariant is proven, record a later implementation row with
  the exact CodeBlob name, instruction/site invariant, ABI, compressed-oops
  applicability, and runtime validation target before editing executable code.
- Completion criteria: either prove a generic and safe way to recover callable
  ZGC runtime leaf targets from named stubs without binding the stubs as call
  targets, or reject this path with the exact missing invariant and choose the
  next barrier-capability route.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: source shows the named C1 load barrier
  blobs are generated by `XBarrierSetC1::generate_c1_runtime_stubs` or
  `ZBarrierSetC1::generate_c1_runtime_stubs`, and the x86 generator emits a
  VM-leaf call to `XBarrierSetRuntime::load_barrier_on_oop_field_preloaded_addr`
  or `ZBarrierSetRuntime::load_barrier_on_oop_field_preloaded_addr`. Fresh
  strict-ZGC logs confirm the default run contains
  `load_barrier_on_oop_field_preloaded_runtime_stub` and weak-load sibling
  CodeBlobs. However, those CodeBlobs are C1 runtime stubs with VM/stub entry
  ABI, not C ABI functions for direct native calls, and binding the raw stub is
  rejected. More importantly, the active `gc/x` source has no corresponding C1
  store-barrier stubs, and neither `gc/x` nor `gc/z` C1 generation provides the
  object-array runtime barrier as a named CodeBlob. This path can at most
  recover a field-load leaf target after an architecture-specific instruction
  invariant is separately proven; it cannot provide the complete load-array and
  store capability required to mark ZGC ready. Reject C1-stub target recovery as
  the next readiness path. The next generic route is to fix the recovered JVMCI
  array ABI for already-published JVMCI slots and separately keep default
  strict-ZGC fail-closed until a complete non-JVMCI store/load capability is
  proven.

### [x] NPT-3al: Correct recovered ZGC object-array barrier ABI

- Scope: correct the native ZGC object-array load barrier ABI from the current
  single-argument/returning call shape to the OpenJDK `void(oop*, size_t)` shape
  for wide oop arrays, update dlsym names accordingly, and bind the recovered
  stripped JVMCI `ZBarrierSetRuntime_load_barrier_on_oop_array` slot only when
  its target is already published and validated inside executable `libjvm.so`.
  The implementation must not use the runtime array barrier for compressed-oop
  array slots, must not bind raw CodeBlob stubs, must not initialize JVMCI, must
  not mark default strict ZGC ready, and must not change store-barrier
  semantics.
- Required evidence: NPT-3aj proves the JVMCI array slot is published under
  eager JVMCI and null in default early layout; local OpenJDK source proves the
  array runtime ABI is `void(oop*, size_t)` while the current native typedef is
  `void *(*)(void*)`; NPT-3ak rejects C1 stubs as a complete readiness path.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests, fresh
  TEST native generation, strict ZGC with eager JVMCI to prove the array slot is
  bound and logged, strict default ZGC to prove it remains fail-closed, and
  generated-C inspection for the corrected ABI and absence of JNI fallback.
- Completion criteria: generated C uses the corrected array typedef/call shape,
  dlsym probes use the corrected mangled two-argument symbol names, recovered
  JVMCI array targets are executable-range validated before binding, compressed
  oop arrays do not call the wide array runtime, and ZGC readiness remains
  blocked by missing complete store/default capability.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: focused generator/audit tests passed. Fresh
  TEST native generation produced
  `build/npt-3al-zgc/TEST-native.jar` from
  `build/neko-native-work/run-13753557747563` with `translated=49 rejected=0`.
  Generated C contains `typedef void (*neko_z_lrb_array_t)(void**, size_t)`,
  the corrected
  `_ZN18{Z,X}BarrierSetRuntime25load_barrier_on_oop_arrayEPP7oopDescm` dlsym
  probes, and executable-range validated array binding logs. Strict ZGC with
  eager JVMCI bound `z_lrb=0x7fe898c4ace0`,
  `z_array=0x7fe898c4ab70`, and `z_bad_off=40`, then still failed closed due
  to missing `z_store`. Default strict ZGC kept field/array slots null and
  failed closed with `z_lrb=(nil)`, `z_array=(nil)`, `z_store=(nil)`.
  Default collector TEST completed with `Calc: 87ms`.

### [x] NPT-3am: Split primitive field volatile access

- Scope: expose resolved Java field `access_flags` through generated native
  field-slot metadata and use it so primitive field helpers emit volatile C
  accesses only for fields with `ACC_VOLATILE`. Non-volatile Java fields should
  use ordinary C loads/stores. Unknown or unresolved metadata must remain
  fail-closed or conservatively volatile; this row must not change object
  reference barrier semantics, field resolution ownership, JNI fallback,
  exception behavior, or ABI layout for unrelated helpers.
- Required evidence: the performance todo identifies current primitive field
  helpers as using volatile pointer dereferences for every primitive load/store,
  while field resolution already records HotSpot field access flags. This row
  must confirm the exact generated slot layout and access sites before editing.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/unit tests with
  repository `./gradlew`, generated-C inspection proving volatile appears only
  on volatile primitive field paths or conservative unknown paths, fresh TEST
  native generation, default collector TEST smoke, and performance samples for
  TEST Calc/Platform if the row passes functional validation.
- Completion criteria: generated metadata carries field volatility generically,
  primitive field helpers preserve volatile semantics for volatile fields,
  normal fields no longer force volatile C memory access, unknown metadata stays
  conservative, and runtime validation shows no regression or fallback.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: fresh source/diff review showed this target
  is already implemented in the current code before any NPT-3am executable
  edit: generated static and instance field refs carry `access_flags_slot`,
  owner binding calls pass `g_access_*` slots to
  `neko_bind_instance_field_offset` and `neko_bind_static_field_metadata`, and
  those bind helpers write `native_field.access_flags` into the slot. Fresh
  generated C from `build/neko-native-work/run-13753557747563` proves primitive
  helpers take `uint32_t access_flags` and branch on `0x0040u`: volatile fields
  use `volatile` pointer access and non-volatile fields use ordinary pointer
  access for all primitive get/set and static get/set helpers. Primitive field
  callsites pass the resolved `g_access_*` slots. Focused generator/audit tests
  passed during NPT-3al, fresh TEST native generation produced `translated=49
  rejected=0`, and default collector TEST completed with `Calc: 87ms`. No
  executable change was needed for this row.

### [x] NPT-3an: Outline hot-helper diagnostics

- Scope: move selected inline `fprintf`/`abort` diagnostic construction out of
  hot native helper bodies into shared `cold`, `noinline` diagnostic functions.
  The first implementation must be narrowly scoped to helpers where the cold
  branch already terminates unconditionally and where argument values can be
  passed without changing evaluation order. It must not change exception
  behavior, pending-exception handling, GC barriers, array bounds/null ordering,
  or field/array access semantics.
- Required evidence: current generated helper source contains inline diagnostic
  blocks in hot array and field helpers; NPT-3am/P5 did not require executable
  edits, leaving P6 as the next performance row.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests, generated
  C inspection proving hot helper bodies call cold diagnostics instead of
  containing large inline diagnostic formatting, fresh TEST native generation,
  and default collector TEST smoke. Broader performance gate remains a later
  row unless this change produces a runtime regression.
- Completion criteria: selected hot helper error paths are outlined to cold
  noinline functions, normal fast-path branches and semantic checks are
  unchanged, generated C compiles, and runtime smoke shows no new failure.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: object-field GETFIELD/GETSTATIC/PUTFIELD/
  PUTSTATIC diagnostic exits were outlined to `cold`, `noinline` hidden helper
  functions. Focused generator/audit tests passed:
  `env GRADLE_USER_HOME=build/gradle-home-native-coverage bash ./gradlew
  :neko-test:test --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.CCodeGeneratorTest --tests
  dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest`. Fresh TEST native
  generation succeeded in `build/neko-native-work/run-14414463312953` with
  `translated=49 rejected=0` and `libneko_linux_x64.so` size `1037656` bytes.
  Generated C inspection showed hot helpers in `neko_native_support.c` call
  `neko_abort_object_*_unavailable`, while
  `neko_native_support_helpers_4.c` defines those functions as
  `__attribute__((visibility("hidden"))) void __attribute__((cold, noinline))`.
  Default collector TEST smoke on `build/npt-3an-r2/TEST-native.jar` completed
  with no stderr and `Calc: 91ms`.

### [x] NPT-3ao: Outline object-array diagnostics

- Scope: move object-array-only diagnostic `fprintf`/`abort` construction from
  `neko_array_store_check`, `neko_fast_aastore`, and `neko_fast_aaload` into
  `cold`, `noinline` hidden helper functions. Keep successful object-array
  fast paths, null and bounds checks, array-store type checks, GC barriers, raw
  oop loads/stores, and handle creation unchanged. Do not touch the primitive
  array diagnostic shape rejected by NPT-3z.
- Required evidence: current source keeps unconditional diagnostic abort blocks
  in object-array helper failure paths. The NPT-3z regression applies to the
  generated primitive-array helpers, while the object-array blocks remain an
  untested portion of P6.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests, fresh
  TEST native generation, generated-C inspection proving object-array hot
  helper bodies call cold diagnostics instead of containing large inline
  formatting blocks, and default collector TEST smoke.
- Completion criteria: selected object-array diagnostic exits are outlined to
  cold noinline helpers, all normal branches and semantic checks are unchanged,
  generated C compiles with `translated>0 rejected=0`, and runtime smoke shows
  no new failure.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: `neko_array_store_check`,
  `neko_fast_aastore`, and `neko_fast_aaload` now call hidden `cold`,
  `noinline` diagnostic helpers for their terminal diagnostic exits. Focused
  generator/audit tests passed:
  `env GRADLE_USER_HOME=build/gradle-home-native-coverage bash ./gradlew
  :neko-test:test --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.CCodeGeneratorTest --tests
  dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest`. Fresh TEST native
  generation succeeded in `build/neko-native-work/run-14632991188519` with
  `translated=49 rejected=0` and `libneko_linux_x64.so` size `1038728` bytes.
  Generated C inspection showed object-array hot helpers in
  `neko_native_support.c` call `neko_abort_aastore_*` and
  `neko_abort_fast_aa*`, while `neko_native_support_helpers_4.c` defines those
  helpers with `visibility("hidden")`, `cold`, and `noinline`. Default
  collector TEST smoke on `build/npt-3ao/TEST-native.jar` completed with no
  stderr and `Calc: 89ms`.

### [x] NPT-3ap: Outline object fused-array diagnostics

- Scope: move object-array checked/fused diagnostic `fprintf`/`abort`
  construction from `neko_checked_aaload`, `neko_checked_aastore`, and
  `neko_fast_aaload_aaload` into hidden `cold`, `noinline` helper functions.
  Keep returned reason codes, null and bounds ordering, handle resolution,
  array-store checks, GC barriers, and raw oop loads/stores unchanged. Do not
  touch generated primitive checked/fused helpers or the primitive direct array
  diagnostic shape rejected by NPT-3z.
- Required evidence: current source still emits unconditional diagnostic aborts
  in object-array checked/fused failure paths after NPT-3ao. These paths are
  separate from the rejected primitive-array direct diagnostic row and can be
  moved without changing success-path semantics.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests, fresh
  TEST native generation, generated-C inspection proving the selected
  object-array checked/fused helpers call cold diagnostics instead of containing
  inline formatting blocks, and default collector TEST smoke.
- Completion criteria: selected object-array checked/fused diagnostic exits are
  outlined to cold noinline helpers, all normal checks and reason-code returns
  are unchanged, generated C compiles with `translated>0 rejected=0`, and
  runtime smoke shows no new failure.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: `neko_checked_aaload`,
  `neko_checked_aastore`, and `neko_fast_aaload_aaload` now call hidden `cold`,
  `noinline` diagnostic helpers for layout and unresolved-handle hard-abort
  paths. Focused generator/audit tests passed:
  `env GRADLE_USER_HOME=build/gradle-home-native-coverage bash ./gradlew
  :neko-test:test --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.CCodeGeneratorTest --tests
  dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest`. Fresh TEST native
  generation succeeded in `build/neko-native-work/run-14840042038598` with
  `translated=49 rejected=0` and `libneko_linux_x64.so` size `1036952` bytes.
  Generated C inspection showed selected checked/fused object-array helpers in
  `neko_native_support.c` call `neko_abort_checked_*` and
  `neko_abort_fused_aaload_aaload_*`, while `neko_native_support_helpers_4.c`
  defines those helpers with `visibility("hidden")`, `cold`, and `noinline`.
  Default collector TEST smoke on `build/npt-3ap/TEST-native.jar` completed
  with no stderr and `Calc: 97ms`; repeated TEST samples showed NPT-3ao
  `88,88,95,95,94 ms` (median `94ms`) versus NPT-3ap
  `89,85,92,88,86 ms` (median `88ms`).

### [rejected] NPT-3aq: Outline fused primitive AALOAD diagnostics

- Scope: move generated fused `AALOAD+xALOAD` and raw fused
  `raw AALOAD+xALOAD` diagnostic layout/outer-handle hard-abort formatting into
  hidden `cold`, `noinline` helper functions. Preserve all reason-code returns
  for outer null, outer bounds, inner null, and inner bounds; preserve the raw
  fused null check before `neko_zgc_good_oop`. Do not touch direct primitive
  array helpers or generated checked primitive load/store helpers.
- Required evidence: current source templates for
  `neko_fast_aaload_{b,c,s,i,l,f,d}aload` and
  `neko_fast_raw_aaload_{b,c,s,i,l,f,d}aload` still emit inline diagnostic
  formatting in hard-abort-only paths. The subagent audit identified these as
  distinct from the NPT-3z rejected direct primitive-array diagnostic shape.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests, fresh
  TEST native generation, generated-C inspection proving fused generated helper
  bodies call cold diagnostics instead of containing inline formatting blocks,
  default collector TEST smoke, and repeated TEST sample comparison against
  NPT-3ap if a smoke timing regresses.
- Completion criteria: generated fused primitive AALOAD diagnostic exits are
  outlined to cold noinline helpers, reason-code behavior is unchanged,
  generated C compiles with `translated>0 rejected=0`, and runtime validation
  shows no new failure or measured regression.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-21: the attempted generic cold-helper shape moved
  `neko_fast_aaload_{b,c,s,i,l,f,d}aload` layout/outer-handle diagnostics and
  `neko_fast_raw_aaload_{b,c,s,i,l,f,d}aload` layout diagnostics to shared
  tag-parameterized cold helpers. Focused generator/audit tests passed, fresh
  generation succeeded in `build/neko-native-work/run-15069482044439` with
  `translated=49 rejected=0` and `libneko_linux_x64.so` size `1037208` bytes,
  generated C inspection proved the intended calls, and default TEST smoke
  completed with no stderr and `Calc: 90ms`. Repeated TEST samples regressed
  versus the NPT-3ap median: NPT-3aq `92,95,98,91,87 ms` (median `92ms`)
  versus NPT-3ap `89,85,92,88,86 ms` (median `88ms`). The source change was
  reverted before commit. Do not retry this tag-parameterized fused primitive
  diagnostic outlining without new branch-layout or compiler-output evidence.

### [x] NPT-3ar: Close descriptor shadow-frame and primitive-volatility rows

- Scope: close stale performance todo rows whose generic implementation is
  already present in the current source and validated by fresh generated
  artifacts. This is an evidence-only audit update; it must not change
  executable code.
- Required evidence: P3 requires one shadow-stack push/pop per translated
  method while replacing three per-slot strings with one descriptor pointer.
  P5 requires primitive field access to branch on resolved Java `ACC_VOLATILE`
  metadata so non-volatile fields use ordinary C loads/stores.
- Validation command or runtime target: source inspection plus generated-C
  inspection from the fresh NPT-3ap TEST artifact, with the same focused tests,
  generation, and smoke evidence already recorded for NPT-3ap/NPT-3am.
- Completion criteria: P3 and P5 todo rows are marked complete only if current
  generated C proves descriptor-pointer shadow frames and access-flag-driven
  primitive field volatility, with no executable diff in this row.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: source emits
  `static const neko_shadow_frame_desc __neko_shadow_desc` and
  `neko_shadow_push(&__neko_shadow_desc)` at translated method entry, and
  runtime support stores only `const neko_shadow_frame_desc *desc` per shadow
  frame before expanding owner/method/file in `neko_shadow_stack_trace`.
  Generated C from `build/neko-native-work/run-14840042038598` shows per-method
  descriptor pushes in `neko_native_impl_*.c`, `neko_shadow_frame` containing
  only `desc`, and trace expansion through `desc->owner`, `desc->method`, and
  `desc->file`. The same generated artifact proves primitive field helpers
  accept `uint32_t access_flags`, branch on `0x0040u`, use `volatile` only for
  volatile paths, and use ordinary pointer loads/stores otherwise. No
  executable source changed in this row.

### [x] NPT-3as: Add dependency shadow-stack fixture

- Scope: add the missing P3 acceptance fixture proving an external, unmodified
  Java classpath caller can invoke translated native code and later observe the
  translated frames produced by the descriptor-backed shadow stack. This is a
  test-only change; it must not change runtime/native code.
- Required evidence: NPT-3ar proved descriptor-pointer shadow frames in source
  and generated C, but the original P3 row also required a dependency-jar
  stack-trace fixture.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` test using repository `./gradlew`.
- Completion criteria: the test creates an input jar containing only the
  native-translated target class, creates a separate dependency jar containing
  the external caller, runs `java -cp <native-output>:<dependency>`, and proves
  the returned stack trace contains translated target frames.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: added
  `nativeObfuscation_dependencyCallerObservesTranslatedStackTrace`, which builds
  `dependency-shadow-target.jar` with `pkg.NativeStackTarget`, builds a separate
  `dependency-shadow-caller.jar` with `dep.ExternalStackCaller`, obfuscates only
  the target jar with `native-test.yml`, and runs `java -cp
  <native-output>:<dependency> dep.ExternalStackCaller`. The caller validates
  the returned stack trace string contains both
  `pkg.NativeStackTarget.leaf` and `pkg.NativeStackTarget.capture`. Focused
  validation passed:
  `env GRADLE_USER_HOME=build/gradle-home-native-coverage bash ./gradlew
  :neko-test:test --tests
  dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest.nativeObfuscation_dependencyCallerObservesTranslatedStackTrace`.
  Runtime stdout was `dependency-stacktrace-ok` and stderr was empty.

### [x] NPT-3at: Tighten translated local-root reservation

- Scope: reduce translated method-entry local-handle reservation only when the
  method ABI and bytecode prove that no reference value is stored in a JVM local
  slot. This is a generic P11 substep that avoids unnecessary
  `neko_prepare_local_oop_roots` calls without reusing HotSpot-owned
  `JNIHandleBlock::_next` blocks.
- Required evidence: current source emits local-root reservation for every
  static primitive-ABI method that is not fully primitive-only; generated TEST
  `Calc.runAll` calls translated `call`, `runAdd`, and `runStr` 10,000 times,
  and `call`/`runAdd` reserve roots even though they have no object-local
  stores while `runStr` needs roots for its string local. P11 ownership audit
  proves reusing existing `_next` blocks is unsafe because restore treats
  `saved_next` as pre-existing caller/VM state and restores `_top` only for the
  saved active block.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests, fresh
  TEST native generation, generated-C inspection for removed/retained
  `neko_prepare_local_oop_roots`, default TEST smoke, and repeated TEST timing
  comparison.
- Completion criteria: instance methods, reference parameters, `ASTORE` paths,
  and reference tail-recursive rewrites still reserve local roots; no-object-local
  static primitive methods do not reserve local roots; generated artifacts report
  `translated>0 rejected=0`; runtime smoke has no fatal/error output; timing does
  not regress.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: `NativeTranslator.methodMayUseObjectLocalRoots`
  now reserves local roots for static primitive-ABI methods only when bytecode
  contains an object-local store; instance methods and reference parameters
  still reserve roots. Focused generator/audit tests passed:
  `env GRADLE_USER_HOME=build/gradle-home-native-coverage bash ./gradlew
  :neko-test:test --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.CCodeGeneratorTest --tests
  dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest
  -Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp`. Fresh TEST native generation produced
  `build/npt-3at/TEST-native.jar` from
  `build/neko-native-work/run-15969669901673` with `translated=49 rejected=0`
  and `libneko_linux_x64.so` size `1034616` bytes. Generated C inspection shows
  `Calc.runAll`, `Calc.call`, and `Calc.runAdd` no longer call
  `neko_prepare_local_oop_roots`, while `Calc.runStr` still reserves roots and
  uses `neko_store_local_oop_ref` for its string local. Direct TEST smoke ran
  cleanly with empty stderr; same-session comparison showed prior accepted
  `npt-3ap` Calc samples `89,90,92,90,90 ms` (median `90ms`) versus NPT-3at
  `88,85,83,101,94 ms` (median `88ms`). Focused native integration tests for
  TEST Calc and obfusjack completion also passed.

### [x] NPT-3au: Split translated direct-call body entry

- Scope: reduce translated-to-translated direct-call raw-entry overhead by
  splitting generated raw methods into an external ABI wrapper and an internal
  body entry. The body entry may skip only the runtime capability checks already
  proven by the caller wrapper/dispatcher; it must preserve all Java-level method
  activation behavior.
- Required evidence: direct-call audit shows `OpcodeTranslator.translateDirectInvoke`
  calls `binding.rawFunctionName()` directly, while every generated raw function
  starts with `neko_hotspot_fast_require(thread, env)`. Fresh NPT-3at TEST C
  still shows `Calc.runAll` calling `Calc.call`, `Calc.runAdd`, and `Calc.runStr`
  in the 10,000-iteration loop, with each callee rerunning the same fast gate.
  `neko_hotspot_fast_require` checks only post-bootstrap fast-state invariants
  (`neko_const_initialized`, non-null `thread`, and supported GC barrier kind)
  and then emits compiler assumptions; callee roots and shadow frames remain
  separate required semantics.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests, fresh
  TEST native generation, generated-C inspection proving external wrappers still
  call `neko_hotspot_fast_require` and internal direct calls target body symbols,
  default TEST smoke, same-session timing comparison, and focused native
  integration tests for TEST Calc and obfusjack completion.
- Completion criteria: manifest/dispatcher ABI continues to target
  `neko_native_impl_*` wrappers; translated internal direct calls target
  `neko_native_impl_*_body`; body entries keep activation arrays, object-local
  roots where required, parameter-to-local rooting, and shadow push/pop; no
  JNI/JVMTI/fallback markers or fatal runtime errors appear; timing does not
  regress.
- Completed 2026-05-22. Focused generator/audit tests passed:
  `CCodeGeneratorTest`, `OpcodeTranslatorUnitTest`, and
  `NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest`. First generated TEST runtime failed with
  `UnsatisfiedLinkError: undefined symbol: neko_native_impl_19_body`, proving the
  exact split-source invariant violation: `_body` declarations were static in
  implementation preludes while callers were in different translation units. The
  generic fix externalizes `_body` prototypes/definitions alongside raw wrappers.
  Fresh generation `build/neko-native-work/run-16584698339661` built
  `libneko_linux_x64.so` at `1034872` bytes with `translated=49 rejected=0`.
  Generated C shows external wrappers call `neko_hotspot_fast_require`, bodies
  call `neko_hotspot_fast_assume`, and `Calc.runAll` calls
  `neko_native_impl_20_body`, `neko_native_impl_21_body`, and
  `neko_native_impl_22_body`. Same-session smoke comparison passed with stderr
  empty: NPT-3at `86,87,90,86,91 ms` (median `87ms`) versus NPT-3au
  `83,86,84,83,96 ms` (median `84ms`). Focused native integration tests for
  TEST Calc and obfusjack completion also passed.
