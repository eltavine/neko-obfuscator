# Native Post-Transfer Performance and Compile-Time Execution Plan - 2026-05-19

## Scope

Continue the current native work after the native transfer/JNI-removal stages by
executing one evidence-backed optimization at a time across two tracks:

- runtime/native-transfer performance: `native-gentle-flamingo-todo.md` Stage 4
  and `native-performance-optimization-todo.md` P3+;
- native compile-time/code-shape performance: continuation after
  `.plan/native-compile-parallelization-2026-05-17.md` P41.

This document is the matching `.plan/` audit queue for the current work. It does
not replace the existing source plans; each implementation row below must update
the source plan that owns the changed path before it can be considered complete.

## Status Legend

- `[ ]` not implemented / not freshly verified
- `[-]` actively in progress only while that exact row is being worked
- `[x]` implemented, freshly regenerated, runtime-verified, inspected, and
  committed where repository policy permits
- `[rejected]` measured and reverted or not retained because acceptance failed

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

- Do not implement or optimize for a special jar, benchmark, class, method,
  owner, descriptor, crash site, or log string.
- Do not weaken JVM ABI behavior, obfuscation coverage, CFF/key-flow semantics,
  native coverage, GC compatibility, or JNI-removal goals.
- Do not add JNI fallback, JVMTI, skip-on-error success, original-bytecode
  fallback, Java helper layers, or new bootstrap behavior.
- Do not reuse stale jars, stale generated C, stale manifests, unit-only passes,
  or compile-only results as runtime proof.
- Use a repository-local temporary directory such as `build/native-run-tmp` for
  runtime commands; do not use `/tmp`.
- Repository `./gradlew` use requires explicit user permission before running.

## Existing Plan State Reconciled Before Implementation

- `native-gentle-flamingo-todo.md` Stage 4 remains open. T4.0 is first in the
  Stage 4 ordering because `neko_exception_check_resolve_env_offset` is recorded
  as a structural post-transfer performance prerequisite before the wider T4.14
  performance gate.
- `native-performance-optimization-todo.md` has P0/P1 complete. P2 is blocked by
  GC strict prerequisites. P3 is partially implemented by
  `.plan/native-compile-parallelization-2026-05-17.md` P25 but still needs the
  broader dependency-jar stack-trace fixture and GC strict compatibility gate.
  P4-P15 remain open.
- `.plan/native-compile-parallelization-2026-05-17.md` has accepted work through
  P41. Rejected rows P27/P29/P33/P34/P36/P37/P40 must not be retried in the same
  shape without new root-cause evidence explaining the rejection.
- `.plan/native-full-validation.md` V1-V3 remain open as a final validation
  sweep, and `.plan/native-full-repair.md` R2-R5 remain open for full native-only
  repair/acceptance.

## Execution Rows

### [x] NPT-0: Reconcile current native performance and compile-time plan state

- Scope: locate the active runtime performance, native transfer, compile-time,
  full-validation, and full-repair plans before changing code.
- Required evidence: exact file paths, open rows, validation targets, rejected
  shapes, and current generated-artifact locations.
- Validation command or runtime target: read-only repository exploration; no
  Gradle or runtime command.
- Completion criteria: this document records the current source-plan state and
  the next executable rows without inventing a bottleneck or changing runtime
  behavior.
- Evidence: completed read-only exploration of
  `native-performance-optimization-todo.md`, `native-gentle-flamingo-todo.md`,
  `.plan/native-compile-parallelization-2026-05-17.md`,
  `.plan/native-full-validation.md`, and `.plan/native-full-repair.md`.

### [x] NPT-1: Capture fresh post-P41 baseline before the next optimization

- Scope: regenerate and measure the current accepted source state after P41 so
  both runtime and compile-time work starts from fresh artifacts, not the stale
  P41 evidence embedded in the plan.
- Required evidence: git revision/status, focused native audit output, fresh
  native-only generation rows for TEST/test21/SnakeGame/evaluator, per-source
  compile/link elapsed rows, generated source counts, packaged library sizes,
  direct runtime stdout/stderr for TEST/test21/evaluator/SnakeGame smoke, parsed
  TEST Calc and test21 Platform/Virtual/Seq/Parallel/VThreads timings, newest
  `hs_err_pid*.log` scan, and generated-C forbidden-marker inspection.
- Validation command or runtime target: after explicit permission to use
  `./gradlew`, run the focused native audit/tests needed to regenerate native
  artifacts, then run native-only generation through `.plan/native-only-full.yml`
  and direct jar commands with `-Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp`.
- Completion criteria: regenerated artifacts report `translated>0 rejected=0`,
  no native compilation fallback, no skip-on-error success, no original-bytecode
  fallback, no executable forbidden JNI/JVMTI markers, no fatal JVM/runtime
  errors, and the next runtime plus compile-time rows are selected from the
  fresh measurements.
- Partial evidence: focused Gradle audit passed after explicit `./gradlew`
  permission with
  `./gradlew :neko-test:test --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.CCodeGeneratorTest
  --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest
  -Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp`. Exit code `0`; Gradle reported
  `BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 8s` with 19 actionable tasks. This is only the focused
  audit checkpoint; NPT-1 remains open until fresh four-jar native-only
  generation, direct runtime runs, manifest/timing capture, `hs_err` scan, and
  forbidden-marker inspection are complete.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-20 at git `4f537f98685afee2debcea9b6e1eb0b2d0a9017a`
  with clean worktree before generation: focused Gradle audit reran after
  explicit permission and passed with
  `./gradlew :neko-test:test --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.CCodeGeneratorTest
  --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest
  -Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp` (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s`, 19
  up-to-date tasks). Fresh `.plan/native-only-full.yml` CLI generation wrote
  `build/native-post-transfer-baseline/{TEST,obfusjack,SnakeGame,evaluator}-native-only.jar`;
  generated counts / translated rows were TEST 67 C files, `translated=49
  rejected=0`; obfusjack 113 C files, `translated=93 rejected=0`; SnakeGame 35
  C files, `translated=18 rejected=0`; evaluator 143 C files, `translated=122
  rejected=0`. Direct runtime logs under `build/native-post-transfer-baseline/`
  had no fatal markers: TEST x5 Calc = 34/39/34/36/35 ms; obfusjack x5
  completed with Seq = 29/28/29/28/29 ms, Parallel = 3/3/3/3/3 ms, VThreads =
  5/7/5/6/6 ms, Platform = 813/771/767/894/865 ms, Virtual =
  793/812/814/892/932 ms; SnakeGame exited with expected headless behavior;
  evaluator exited 0. No `hs_err_pid*.log` was created under
  `build/native-run-tmp`, `build/native-post-transfer-baseline`, or
  `build/neko-native-work`; newest root `hs_err_pid1039252.log` predates this
  run. Generated-C executable-marker inspection in
  `build/native-post-transfer-baseline/native-post-transfer-baseline-summary.json`
  found zero `NEKO_JNI_FN_PTR`, `(*env)->`, `env->`, function-table indexing,
  JNI call wrappers, array JNI wrappers, or JVMTI markers. Compile totals/top
  rows are recorded in the same summary JSON.

### [ ] NPT-2: Stage 4 T4.0 eager exception-check env-offset publication

- Scope: implement the Stage 4.A structural performance prerequisite from
  `native-gentle-flamingo-todo.md` T4.0: ensure
  `neko_exception_check_resolve_env_offset` is not reachable from the hot
  `neko_exception_check` path after publication.
- Required evidence: current generated C and runtime logs proving the resolver
  can still be reached from hot exception-check sites, the exact publication
  invariant chosen (`JNI_OnLoad` bootstrap, first dispatcher entry, TLS cache, or
  outlined unlikely helper), and generated C proving the hot path is an
  acquire-load plus pointer arithmetic plus `_pending_exception` read.
- Validation command or runtime target: `R-build`, `R-test` x5,
  `R-obfusjack` x5, `R-native-obfusjack` x10, `R-inspect`, and `R-negative` as
  specified by T4.0, with fresh artifacts only.
- Completion criteria: perf/debug evidence shows at most one env-offset
  derivation per process, missing-offset paths hard abort, TEST Calc and
  obfusjack timing gates do not regress, and generated/runtime inspection shows
  no new JNI function-table use or fallback path.
- Dependency: NPT-1, unless a plan-level update records why a narrower fresh
  baseline is sufficient.

### [-] NPT-3: Runtime P4 const fast-state accessor layer

- Scope: implement `native-performance-optimization-todo.md` P4 after the T4.0
  hot exception-check path is stable: post-bootstrap immutable fast-state
  accessors should read `g_hotspot_const` instead of mutable-looking
  `g_hotspot`, while collector-dynamic values such as ZGC mask pointers remain
  mutable.
- Required evidence: generated C/source inspection proving which accessors are
  immutable after bootstrap, which collector fields must remain dynamic, and how
  the changed accessors are used by hot helpers.
- Validation command or runtime target: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`,
  `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, performance gate, and GC strict compatibility
  gate from `native-performance-optimization-todo.md` P4.
- Completion criteria: generated C or compiler diagnostics show the intended
  immutable reads use `g_hotspot_const`, dynamic GC mask paths remain mutable,
  TEST/obfusjack runtime and GC gates pass with fresh artifacts, and no ABI,
  GC, JNI-removal, or fallback invariant is weakened.
- Dependency update: NPT-1 fresh generated C shows T4.0's structural hot path
  is already present in current source: `neko_exception_check` reads
  `g_neko_off_thread_jni_environment_for_check` directly, and the cold
  resolver is driven from `neko_method_layout_init`, not from the hot path.
  The remaining measured gap is performance, so P4 is the next generic
  post-bootstrap invariant optimization before revisiting wider T4.0/T4.14
  gates.
- P4 implementation evidence 2026-05-20: changed only
  `NativeHotSpotFastAccessEmitter` const accessors so post-bootstrap immutable
  fields read `g_hotspot_const`; source and generated C keep ZGC live-mask
  helpers on mutable `g_hotspot.z_zglobals_*` pointers. Focused Gradle audit
  passed:
  `./gradlew :neko-test:test --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.CCodeGeneratorTest
  --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest
  -Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp` (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 6s`).
  Fresh `.plan/native-only-full.yml` artifacts in
  `build/native-post-transfer-p4/` report TEST `translated=49 rejected=0`,
  obfusjack `translated=93 rejected=0`, SnakeGame `translated=18 rejected=0`,
  evaluator `translated=122 rejected=0`; generated TEST C
  `build/neko-native-work/run-3244581472985/neko_native_support.c` shows all
  `neko_const_*` immutable accessors reading `g_hotspot_const`, while dynamic
  ZGC mask helpers still read mutable mask pointers. Runtime: TEST x5 Calc =
  35/35/35/33/34 ms; obfusjack x5 completed with Seq = 23/23/23/22/25 ms,
  Parallel = 3/3/3/3/3 ms, VThreads = 4/5/6/4/5 ms. SnakeGame preserved
  headless behavior; evaluator exited 0. `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`
  passed (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 40s`). P4 remains `[-]` rather than `[x]`
  because the full performance gate still misses TEST Calc <= 20 ms and GC
  strict remains blocked: ZGC/Shenandoah abort at existing mask publication
  diagnostics (`ZGC oop load masks unavailable addr=0x0 good=0x0`), and
  Parallel/Serial obfusjack direct runs did not provide a clean strict-gate
  completion under the 240s direct-run cap.
- User-updated acceptance recorded 2026-05-20: Calc must match or beat the
  original JVM jar in the same run environment; obfusjack Seq must be <= 10 ms;
  every other parsed benchmark/test timing must match original or stay within
  1.5x slowdown. Older absolute threshold rows are superseded for ongoing
  performance work.

### [-] NPT-3a: Runtime P10 generic NJX call-parameter packing

- Scope: continue runtime performance work by optimizing only the generic
  native-to-Java call-stub machinery used to jump to original JVM methods.
  This row must not add owner/name/descriptor-specific native implementations.
- Required evidence: audit of current translator/codegen special cases, rollback
  of the uncommitted `java/lang/Math` → C libm lowering, source/generated-C
  proof that Math calls still bind and jump through NJX to the original JVM
  methods, and generated-C proof that full `memset(call_params, ...)` is gone
  while every used call parameter slot and required two-slot padding word is
  explicitly initialized.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests with
  repository `./gradlew` after permission, then the owning P10 runtime gate
  before marking complete.
- Completion criteria: no `translateMathIntrinsicInvoke`, libm call, or `-lm`
  link flag remains; generated C contains bound `java/lang/Math` method entries
  rather than native math calls; NJX stack packing preserves the previous zeroed
  high/padding words without full-array memset; no JNI/JVMTI/original-bytecode
  fallback or target-method control-flow replacement is introduced.
- Evidence update 2026-05-20: rolled back the forbidden `java/lang/Math` native
  intrinsic route and removed the unused method-specific native helper bodies
  for `String.length`, `Object.getClass`, `String.concat`, and
  `Atomic*.addAndGet`. Source audit over `neko-native/src/main/java` found no
  remaining `translateMathIntrinsicInvoke`, libm `sqrt`/`pow`, `-lm`, or those
  fast helper definitions; generated audit over
  `build/neko-native-work/run-5500725993204` found no emitted forbidden helper
  symbols or libm calls. The remaining `translateIntrinsicMethodInvoke` cases
  are caller/stack compatibility bridges, not performance replacements.
- Evidence update 2026-05-20: retained only generic native-to-Java machinery
  changes: explicit NJX `call_params` slot initialization, shape-specialized
  call-stub parameter packing, receiver inline-cache keys derived from the
  already-resolved `Klass*`, and fused nested-array helper cleanup that removes
  a duplicate outer-bounds check after the same check has already succeeded.
  These changes preserve the original JVM/JDK target call; no named target
  method body is implemented in native code.
- Validation update 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed with
  `./gradlew :neko-test:test --rerun-tasks --tests
  dev.nekoobfuscator.test.CCodeGeneratorTest --tests
  dev.nekoobfuscator.test.OpcodeTranslatorUnitTest --tests
  dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest
  -Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp` (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, artifact
  `artifact://112`). Full native integration passed with
  `./gradlew :neko-test:test --rerun-tasks --tests
  dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest
  -Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp` (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, artifact
  `artifact://114`).
- Open gate evidence 2026-05-20: parity is still not accepted. Fresh repeated
  direct runs written to
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-current/summary-after-generic.json` recorded
  TEST original/native Calc medians `12 ms` / `135 ms`; obfusjack
  original/native medians Seq `2 ms` / `19 ms`, Platform `25 ms` / `50 ms`,
  Virtual `15 ms` / `47 ms`. This row remains `[-]`; no checkpoint commit is
  valid until the parity gate is met or the retained subset is split into an
  accepted, freshly validated prerequisite row.
  - Evidence update 2026-05-20: read-only forbidden-substitution audit
    `agent://8-ForbiddenNativeSubstitutionAudit` found no remaining
    owner/name/descriptor-specific performance replacements for Math/libm,
    String.length/concat, Object.getClass, Atomic addAndGet, or similar
    targets in the requested native translator/codegen files. Remaining named
    cases are compatibility bridges that call cached original JVM Method*
    targets through NJX.

### [rejected] NPT-3b: Runtime P10 compiled-entry NJX bridge prototype

- Scope: replace the shape-specialized NJX call-stub bridge with the existing
  generic compiled-entry trampoline path only if the trampoline calls each
  supplied Method* `_from_compiled_entry` target unchanged. This must not
  implement any owner/name/descriptor-specific Java/JDK method in native code
  and must not alter translated-target selection.
- Required evidence: source and generated-C proof that direct, virtual, helper,
  reflection-adapter, String concat/valueOf, and implicit-exception NJX sites
  pass compiled-entry pointers when the bridge expects compiled entries; proof
  that each generated shape is keyed only by ABI shape; runtime logs or
  generated C proving original JVM/JDK methods are still invoked by Method*
  entry pointers instead of native replacements.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests with
  repository `./gradlew`, `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct TEST and
  obfusjack parity runs under `-Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp`, and
  generated-C forbidden-marker inspection. If any runtime, verifier, GC-root,
  stack-walk, or parity gate fails, revert this row before trying another
  optimization.
- Completion criteria: fresh artifacts report `translated>0 rejected=0`; no
  fatal JVM/runtime errors, JNI/JVMTI wrappers, fallback markers, or native
  method-body substitutions are present; TEST Calc and obfusjack parsed
  timings move toward same-run original JVM parity without replacing original
  target calls.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://151`), but fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` failed with
  repeated SIGSEGVs in HotSpot stack walking / `Throwable.fillInStackTrace`
  while frames crossed `~BufferBlob::neko_njx_trampoline` (`artifact://153`,
  `artifact://155`, `hs_err_pid1442764.log`, `hs_err_pid1500630.log`).
  Adjusting the synthetic BufferBlob frame size from `8 + stackArgs + pad` to
  `9 + stackArgs + pad` did not remove the crash. The compiled-entry bridge
  prototype was reverted before any checkpoint commit because it violates the
  row's stack-walk/runtime acceptance criteria.

### [x] NPT-3c: Runtime P10 call_stub guard register-save trim

- Scope: optimize only the generic HotSpot call_stub bridge used by
  shape-specialized NJX dispatchers. The bridge must keep calling the supplied
  original Method* entry and must not introduce any owner/name/descriptor
  native implementation.
- Required evidence: the current guarded bridge saves callee-saved registers
  around a C-ABI call to HotSpot `call_stub`; the proposed change may remove
  only wrapper-local redundant saves while preserving SysV stack alignment and
  the two stack-passed call_stub arguments. Generated C must still call
  `neko_call_stub_guarded` / `g_neko_call_stub_entry` with the same Method* and
  entry pointers.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct TEST and obfusjack parity runs, and
  generated-C forbidden-marker inspection under
  `-Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp`.
- Completion criteria: fresh artifacts run without SIGSEGV/SIGABRT/verifier
  errors, no forbidden JNI/JVMTI/fallback or method-body substitution appears,
  and same-run direct timings improve or do not regress versus the committed
  call_stub baseline.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-20: removed the wrapper-local callee-saved
  register pushes/pops and alignment-only `subq $8` from
  `neko_call_stub_guarded`; the bridge still passes the same call_stub, Method*,
  entry pointer, parameter stack, result buffer, and JavaThread arguments to
  HotSpot. Focused generator/audit tests passed (`artifact://167`) and
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed (`artifact://169`). Fresh direct
  parity runs under `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10c/` completed with no
  fatal markers: TEST original/native Calc medians `11 ms` / `134 ms`;
  obfusjack original/native medians Seq `2 ms` / `18 ms`, Platform
  `26 ms` / `50 ms`, Virtual `15 ms` / `44 ms`. Generated C inspection in
  `build/neko-native-work/run-7465333913274/neko_native_support.c` preserved
  call_stub dispatch and did not reintroduce Math/libm or named JDK native
  substitutions. The row is an accepted generic call_stub bridge micro-
  optimization, but P10 remains open because same-run original JVM parity is
  still not achieved.

### [rejected] NPT-3d: Runtime P10 bounded JavaCallWrapper zeroing

- Scope: reduce per-NJX-call stack zeroing in the call_stub bridge by clearing
  only the generated JavaCallWrapper prefix that is actually populated and
  whose frame-anchor extent is already validated before every call. This must
  keep the same HotSpot call_stub target, Method*, entry pointer, arguments,
  result handling, handle scope, and thread-state transitions.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that the cleared byte count covers
  the thread, JNIHandleBlock, Method*, receiver, and JavaFrameAnchor fp/pc/sp
  fields before call_stub observes the wrapper; runtime validation must reject
  any stack-walk, exception, GC-root, or verifier failure.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct TEST and obfusjack parity runs, and
  generated-C forbidden-marker inspection under
  `-Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp`.
- Completion criteria: no SIGSEGV/SIGABRT/verifier/fatal markers; no forbidden
  JNI/JVMTI/fallback or named method-body substitutions; same-run direct
  timings improve or do not regress relative to the NPT-3c checkpoint.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://179`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://181`), but fresh direct parity runs in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10d/` regressed against the NPT-3c checkpoint:
  TEST native Calc median `136 ms` vs `134 ms`; obfusjack native Seq
  `19 ms` vs `18 ms`; Virtual `46 ms` vs `44 ms` while Platform remained
  `50 ms`. The bounded-zeroing source change was reverted before any
  implementation checkpoint because the row's no-regression criterion was not
  met.

### [rejected] NPT-3e: Runtime P10 Java-thread-state hot branch

- Scope: optimize only the generic NJX call_stub thread-state precheck by making
  the already-required `_thread_in_java` path the predicted fallthrough. Native
  callers must still transition through `neko_transition_native_to_java`; any
  unsupported state must still hard abort.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that the same call_stub Method*
  and entry pointers are used and that only branch shape changed.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3c.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://186`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://188`), but direct timing did not meet the no-regression gate.
  Partial five-run parity in `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10e/` recorded TEST
  native Calc values `137/132/136/137/134 ms`; the obfusjack native series hit
  a 120s timeout during the third repeated run. A follow-up three-run obfusjack
  native check under `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10e-extra/` completed but
  showed Platform `53/53/52 ms` versus the NPT-3c median `50 ms`. The branch
  hint source change was reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3f: Runtime P10 direct call_stub guard arguments

- Scope: remove the per-NJX-call temporary `neko_call_stub_args_t` aggregate
  from the generic call_stub bridge and pass the same call_stub arguments
  directly through the guard function's C ABI. The guard must still invoke the
  supplied HotSpot `call_stub` with the same JavaCallWrapper mirror, Method*,
  entry pointer, parameter stack, result buffer, result type, and JavaThread.
- Required evidence: generated-C proof that the guard call is still shape-
  generic and not owner/name/descriptor-specific; source proof that the x86-64
  SysV stack-passed `size` and `thread` arguments keep correct alignment.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3c.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://199`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://201`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10f/` regressed against NPT-3c on TEST Calc
  and obfusjack Platform/Virtual: TEST native Calc median `136 ms` vs `134 ms`;
  obfusjack native Seq improved `17 ms` vs `18 ms`, but Platform was
  `51 ms` vs `50 ms` and Virtual was `45 ms` vs `44 ms`. The direct-argument
  source/test changes were reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3g: Runtime P11 conditional JNIHandleBlock `_last` publication

- Scope: optimize the generic local-handle push paths by writing
  `JNIHandleBlock::_last` only when a previously empty active block receives
  its first pushed handle. Overflow block creation must still initialize its
  own `_last`, and restore must still restore the saved `_last` value.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that every active block with
  `_top > 0` still has `_last == block` before HotSpot can allocate into it,
  while repeated pushes into the same non-empty block avoid redundant `_last`
  stores. This must apply generically to signature-dispatch and raw-oop return
  handle paths, not to a benchmark-specific method.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/GC-root/forbidden-marker regressions
  and same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3c.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://206`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://208`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10g/` did not meet the no-regression gate.
  TEST native Calc values were `132/133/137/138/138 ms` (median `137 ms`,
  worse than NPT-3c `134 ms`), and the obfusjack native repeated run timed out
  once at 180s after four completed runs. The conditional `_last` source
  changes were reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [x] NPT-3h: Runtime P10 return-kind-specific NJX result loads

- Scope: optimize only shape-specialized NJX call_stub result unpacking by
  loading `__call_result` according to the known return kind: integer/object
  returns read the integer lane, float/double returns read the FP lane, and
  void returns read neither. The HotSpot call_stub target, Method*, entry
  pointer, argument stack, exception behavior, handle scope, and target method
  selection must remain unchanged.
- Required evidence: generated-C proof that each shape still uses the same
  call_stub bridge and only omits dead result-lane loads for return kinds that
  cannot observe them.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3c.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-20: shape-specialized NJX dispatchers now load
  only the result lane required by their return kind: void shapes skip
  `__call_result` reads, integer/object shapes load `out_rax`, and FP shapes
  copy only `out_xmm0`. Focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://214`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://216`). Fresh direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10h/` completed with no fatal markers: TEST
  original/native Calc medians `12 ms` / `134 ms`; obfusjack original/native
  medians Seq `2 ms` / `17 ms`, Platform `26 ms` / `50 ms`, Virtual
  `14 ms` / `44 ms`. Generated-C inspection of
  `build/neko-native-work/run-9173021508276/neko_native_support.c` shows
  call_stub dispatch is still used and the old combined
  `out_rax = ...; memcpy(&out_xmm0, ...)` unpack is gone from shape bodies.
  The row is accepted as a generic bridge micro-optimization; full P10 parity
  remains open.

### [rejected] NPT-3i: Runtime P10 single-slot NJX result buffer

- Scope: reduce the shape-specialized NJX call_stub result buffer from two
  machine words to the single `intptr_t` word needed to hold any JVM primitive
  or object return lane on the supported 64-bit targets. The call_stub result
  pointer and BasicType must remain unchanged, and void/integer/object/FP
  returns must preserve their existing semantics.
- Required evidence: generated-C proof that the buffer remains at least
  `sizeof(intptr_t)` and all result unpacking reads only that word after
  NPT-3h. This must be shape-generic and not target a method owner/name.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://221`), but fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` failed in
  `nativeObfuscation_randomRuntimeStableTenRuns` because
  `obfusjack-native.jar` timed out after 45s (`artifact://223`). The
  single-slot result-buffer source change was reverted before any
  implementation checkpoint because the runtime stability gate failed.

### [rejected] NPT-3j: Runtime P10 constant-index NJX call parameter packing

- Scope: optimize only shape-specialized NJX call parameter packing by emitting
  constant `call_params` slot indexes for each known ABI shape instead of the
  mutable `__njx_pos` cursor. The exact slot layout, two-slot long/double
  padding word, object handle unwrapping, Method*, entry pointer, and call_stub
  behavior must remain unchanged.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that generated shapes use fixed
  slot indexes and still preserve the existing zero-padding semantics for
  one-slot primitives and two-slot long/double arguments.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://227`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://229`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10j/` did not meet the no-regression gate.
  TEST native Calc values were `140/140/133/136/134 ms` (median `136 ms`,
  worse than NPT-3h `134 ms`), and the obfusjack native repeated run timed out
  once at 180s after three completed runs. The constant-index packing source
  change was reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3k: Runtime P10 return-kind-specific NJX result locals

- Scope: continue NPT-3h by emitting only the result local variables and debug
  log arguments required by each shape return kind. Integer/object shapes need
  only `out_rax`, FP shapes need only `out_xmm0`, and void shapes need neither.
  The call_stub result buffer, BasicType, Method*, entry pointer, arguments,
  handle scope, and exception behavior must remain unchanged.
- Required evidence: generated-C proof that result locals/logging are
  return-kind-specific and no target method body or control-flow replacement is
  introduced.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://235`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://237`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10k/` did not meet the no-regression gate.
  TEST native Calc values were `138/146/139/133/138 ms` (median `138 ms`,
  worse than NPT-3h `134 ms`), and the obfusjack native repeated run timed out
  once at 180s after two completed runs. The return-kind-local source change
  was reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3l: Runtime P10 mark call_stub guard hot

- Scope: mark the generic x86-64 `neko_call_stub_guarded` wrapper as a hot
  function so the native compiler places/optimizes the mandatory bridge as hot
  code. The wrapper remains `naked`, `noinline`, and calls the same supplied
  HotSpot call_stub with the same arguments.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that only the function attribute
  changed and no owner/name/descriptor-specific method body or target selection
  behavior changed.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://243`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://245`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10l/` regressed against NPT-3h: TEST native
  Calc median `140 ms` vs `134 ms`, obfusjack native Platform `51 ms` vs
  `50 ms`, and Virtual `47 ms` vs `44 ms` while Seq remained `17 ms`. The
  `hot` attribute source change was reverted before any implementation
  checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3m: Runtime P6 primitive-array cold failure outlining

- Scope: outline only the primitive array helper failure `fprintf`/`abort`
  blocks into cold noinline helpers. Fast-path null/bounds/metadata checks,
  array load/store semantics, exception/fail-closed behavior, and generated
  target method selection must remain unchanged.
- Required evidence: generated-C proof that `neko_fast_*aload` and
  `neko_fast_*astore` hot bodies call cold failure helpers instead of carrying
  inline `fprintf` blocks.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://250`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://252`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10m/` did not meet the no-regression gate.
  TEST native Calc values were `136/141/135/143/139 ms` (median `139 ms`,
  worse than NPT-3h `134 ms`), and the obfusjack native repeated run timed out
  once at 180s after two completed runs. The primitive-array cold failure
  helper source change was reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3n: Runtime P10 remove hot NJX dispatch stats counter

- Scope: remove only the per-NJX-call diagnostic dispatch counter from the hot
  shape-specialized call_stub path. Direct invocation remains mandatory, debug
  logging still works through `NEKO_DIRECT_LOG`, resolve-failure counting
  remains available, and target Method*/entry selection is unchanged.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that shape dispatchers no longer
  call `neko_njx_note_dispatch()` while call_stub, Method*, entry pointer,
  parameter stack, result unpacking, exception checks, and handle scopes remain
  unchanged.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://260`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://262`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10n/` did not meet the no-regression gate.
  TEST native Calc values were `142/139/141/141/135 ms` (median `141 ms`,
  worse than NPT-3h `134 ms`), and the obfusjack native repeated run timed out
  once at 180s after one completed run. The dispatch-stats source change was
  reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3o: Runtime P10 localize NJX debug log gate

- Scope: keep NJX debug logging behavior but avoid repeated hot-path
  `neko_njx_debug()` loads in each shape-specialized call_stub dispatcher by
  caching the debug gate in a local and using it for the entry/exit debug log
  branches. Direct invocation, dispatch stats, resolve-failure stats, Method*,
  entry pointer, arguments, handle scopes, and exception behavior must remain
  unchanged.
- Required evidence: generated-C proof that shape dispatchers still emit the
  same debug log strings when enabled and still call the same HotSpot call_stub
  target; no owner/name/descriptor-specific method body replacement is allowed.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://268`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://270`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10o/` did not meet the no-regression gate.
  TEST native Calc values were `138/138/141/142/136 ms` (median `138 ms`,
  worse than NPT-3h `134 ms`), and the obfusjack native repeated run timed out
  once at 180s after four completed runs. The local debug-gate source change
  was reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [x] NPT-3p: Runtime P10 remove unused generic NJX dispatcher body

- Scope: delete only the generated static generic NJX dispatcher and its
  generic return-BasicType helper after source search proves registered call
  sites emit shape-specialized dispatchers. This removes dead generated C and
  must not change any Method*/entry target, call_stub bridge, argument packing,
  handle scope, exception behavior, or debug behavior on reachable paths.
- Required evidence: source search showing `neko_njx_dispatch_generic` is not
  referenced by any emitted callsite; generated C still contains the
  shape-specialized `neko_njx_*` dispatchers and no generic dispatcher body.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests and
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`. Direct parity is recorded if runtime
  paths change; this row is intended to remove unreachable code only.
- Completion criteria: fresh integration passes, generated C has no
  `neko_njx_dispatch_generic`, no forbidden JNI/JVMTI/fallback or named
  method-body substitution appears, and worktree is checkpointed.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-20: source search found no emitter callsite for
  `neko_njx_dispatch_generic`; all reachable callsites use shape-specialized
  dispatchers registered through `renderShapeCallStub`. Removed the unused
  generated generic dispatcher body and its private `neko_njx_result_basic_type`
  helper. Focused generator/audit tests passed (`artifact://280`) and fresh
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed (`artifact://282`). Generated C in
  `build/neko-native-work/run-12646002423282/` contains shape-specialized
  `neko_njx_*` dispatchers and no `neko_njx_dispatch_generic` or
  `neko_njx_result_basic_type` symbols; target Method*/entry call paths remain
  shape-specialized call_stub dispatches with no named JVM/JDK native method
  replacement.

### [x] NPT-3q: Runtime P10 remove obsolete compiled-entry trampoline generator

- Scope: delete the unused Java emitter code and generated declarations for the
  rejected compiled-entry NJX trampoline path. The retained generated runtime
  must continue to use HotSpot call_stub shape dispatchers for original JVM
  Method*/entry targets; no call target, argument packing, handle scope,
  exception behavior, or thread-state transition may change.
- Required evidence: source search proves `renderBodies()` emits
  `renderShapeCallStub` and no code references the compiled-entry generator,
  wrapper globals, or trampoline begin/end symbols after cleanup.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests and
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`.
- Completion criteria: fresh integration passes, generated C has no unused
  `g_njx_wrapper_*` or `neko_njx_tramp_*` declarations, and shape-specialized
  call_stub dispatchers remain present.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-20: removed the unused compiled-entry trampoline
  emitter, per-shape `neko_njx_tramp_*` declarations, `g_njx_wrapper_*`
  globals, and unused runtime/frame-layout helper code from
  `NativeToJavaInvokeEmitter`. Focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://287`) and fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://289`). Generated C under
  `build/neko-native-work/run-12921477179290/` contains no
  `g_njx_wrapper*`, `neko_njx_tramp_*`, or `neko_njx_runtime_t` symbols while
  retaining shape-specialized `neko_njx_*` call_stub dispatchers for the same
  Method*/entry targets.

### [rejected] NPT-3r: Runtime P12 remove unused virtual icache declared-mid argument

- Scope: remove the virtual/interface `neko_icache_dispatch` declared-method
  `jmethodID` parameter because the current generic dispatch path resolves the
  concrete target from receiver `Klass*` plus callsite name/descriptor metadata
  and never dereferences the declared id. This must not change receiver-null
  handling, exact-method resolution, Method*/entry target selection, PIC
  storage, or call_stub dispatch.
- Required evidence: source/generator proof that the parameter is used only as
  a null precondition and diagnostic value, and generated C proves callsites no
  longer bind/load a declared `jmethodID` solely for `neko_icache_dispatch`.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://296`), but fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` failed
  (`artifact://298`) in `nativeObfuscation_randomRuntimeStableTenRuns` with
  an obfusjack native timeout after 45s. The timed-out run reached only the
  platform-thread section in
  `neko-test/build/test-native/native_obfusjack_stability_9.stdout.log`, so
  the declared-`jmethodID` removal was reverted before any implementation
  checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3s: Runtime P12 outline virtual icache miss resolver

- Scope: split only the cold virtual/interface `neko_icache_dispatch` miss
  resolution block into a `cold,noinline` helper. The hot dispatch function
  must keep receiver null/meta checks, receiver `Klass*` key computation, PIC
  lookup, direct-C hits, direct-NJX hits, and the same Method*/entry/call_stub
  target path. No owner/name/descriptor-specific native implementation may be
  introduced.
- Required evidence: generated-C proof that `neko_icache_dispatch` contains
  the PIC hit path and calls `neko_icache_dispatch_miss` only after a miss,
  while the miss helper still performs the existing exact receiver method
  resolution and call_stub dispatch.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://307`) and fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://309`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10s/` failed the no-regression gate. TEST
  native Calc was `137/134/138/136/139 ms` (median `137 ms`, worse than
  NPT-3h `134 ms`), and obfusjack native was Seq `18/18/19/18/18 ms`
  (median `18 ms`, worse than `17 ms`) and Platform `53/55/55/42/52 ms`
  (median `53 ms`, worse than `50 ms`). The cold-miss outline source change
  was reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3t: Runtime P11 direct-oop handle fast-slot prediction

- Scope: add generic branch prediction only to the `neko_direct_oop_to_handle`
  active JNIHandleBlock slot availability check. The helper must still push
  the same raw oop into the same active JNIHandleBlock slot, update `_top` and
  `_last` exactly as before, allocate an overflow block only on the same
  overflow condition, and hard-abort on the same unavailable paths.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that only the generic
  `top < g_neko_jnih_block_capacity` predicate is marked as the expected fast
  path and no owner/name/descriptor-specific method replacement or handle
  semantics change is introduced.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://315`) and fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://317`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10t/` did not complete: the fifth obfusjack
  native run timed out after 180s. Completed runs did not justify retaining
  the change: TEST native Calc median was `134 ms`, but obfusjack native Seq
  completed values were `17/18/18/17 ms` and the run timed out before the
  required five-run median. The branch-prediction source change was reverted
  before any implementation checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3u: Runtime P10 no-handle NJX for static primitive shapes

- Scope: extend the existing descriptor-proven no-handle-window policy to
  native-to-Java call_stub dispatchers only for static shapes with primitive
  arguments and primitive/void returns. The dispatcher must still call the
  original Method*/entry through HotSpot call_stub, preserve JavaCallWrapper
  anchor fields, thread-state handling, exception handling, and all reference
  shapes' handle save/install/restore behavior.
- Required evidence: generated-C proof that only `S:*` shapes with no `L`
  argument and no `L` return omit `neko_handle_save`,
  `neko_njx_install_java_handles`, `neko_njx_restore_java_handles`, and
  `neko_handle_restore`; virtual, object-arg, and object-return NJX shapes must
  retain the handle frame.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://325`) and fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://327`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10u/` did not complete: the fifth obfusjack
  native run timed out after 180s. Completed TEST native Calc median was
  `134 ms`, but obfusjack native completed values were Seq `17/18/18/17 ms`,
  Platform `52/51/51/51 ms`, and Virtual `44/42/47/45 ms`; the incomplete
  obfusjack run fails the required no-regression gate. The no-handle NJX
  source change was reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3v: Runtime P10 skip empty JavaFrameAnchor copy

- Scope: optimize only generic NJX call_stub JavaFrameAnchor bookkeeping.
  When all saved JavaThread anchor slots are already null (`saved_sp`,
  `saved_pc`, and `saved_fp`), skip copying those nulls into the already
  zeroed JavaCallWrapper anchor and skip clearing the already-empty thread
  anchor. Keep the existing full JavaCallWrapper `memset`, Method*/entry
  target, call_stub invocation, parameters, result buffer, handle frame,
  thread-state transitions, exception handling, and final anchor restore.
- Required evidence: OpenJDK 21 JavaCallWrapper/JavaFrameAnchor source shows
  empty anchors are represented by null anchor slots and `clear()` writes nulls;
  generated C proves only the pre-call anchor copy/clear block is conditional
  on null slots, with no owner/name/descriptor-specific native replacement.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://338`) and fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://340`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10v/` failed the no-regression gate. TEST
  native Calc was `136/137/136/137/140 ms` (median `137 ms`, worse than
  NPT-3h `134 ms`), and obfusjack native Virtual was `47/46/48/46/40 ms`
  (median `46 ms`, worse than `44 ms`) while Seq stayed median `17 ms` and
  Platform stayed median `50 ms`. The anchor fast-path source change was
  reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3w: Runtime P10 shrink NJX stack handle block buffer

- Scope: reduce only the fixed stack reserve used for NJX call_stub's
  temporary JNIHandleBlock from 512 bytes to 384 bytes. Runtime still checks
  `stack_handles_size >= sizeof_JNIHandleBlock` before using the stack block
  and falls back to the existing heap block path when a JVM layout is larger.
  Current validation logs show the JDK 21 `JNIHandleBlock` layout is 296 bytes,
  so 384 preserves the stack path for the measured runtime while reducing each
  NJX dispatcher frame footprint. Method*/entry target selection, call_stub
  invocation, JavaCallWrapper, thread state, exception handling, and handle
  restore semantics must remain unchanged.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that only
  `__njx_handle_buf` size changed, layout logs show `blk_size=296`, and no
  owner/name/descriptor-specific native replacement is introduced.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://346`) and fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
  (`artifact://348`), but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10w/` failed the no-regression gate. TEST
  native Calc stayed median `134 ms`, and obfusjack native Seq stayed median
  `17 ms`, but Platform regressed to median `52 ms` vs NPT-3h `50 ms`, and
  Virtual regressed to median `46 ms` vs `44 ms`. The 384-byte NJX stack
  handle buffer source change was reverted before any implementation
  checkpoint.

### [rejected] NPT-3x: Runtime P10 use cached patch debug flag in handle resolver

- Scope: replace the remaining hot `getenv("NEKO_PATCH_DEBUG")` checks inside
  `neko_handle_oop` with the existing cached `NEKO_PATCH_DEBUG` macro. This
  must only change debug gating; direct-oop classification, ZGC bootstrap
  handling, local/global handle resolution, GC barriers, Method*/entry target
  selection, call_stub invocation, and exception behavior must remain
  unchanged.
- Required evidence: generated-C proof that `neko_handle_oop` no longer calls
  `getenv` on the hot handle path and still emits the same diagnostic blocks
  behind `NEKO_PATCH_DEBUG`, with no owner/name/descriptor-specific native
  replacement.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-20: focused generator/audit tests passed
  (`artifact://356`), but fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` failed
  (`artifact://358`) with SIGSEGV in obfusjack runs; the debug runtime log
  wrote `hs_err_pid3307640.log` and crashed after `merged=579.0`. The handle
  debug-cache source change was reverted before any implementation checkpoint.

### [x] NPT-3y: Runtime P10 inline cached interpreted-entry lookup

- Scope: optimize only the generated `neko_bound_method_i_entry_ref` path used
  by static/direct and helper NJX callsites before entering HotSpot call_stub.
  After bind-time has populated the interpreted-entry slot, generated code
  should read the cached slot directly and call `neko_bound_method_i_entry`
  only on the existing null/missing-entry path. This preserves the same
  original JVM Method*/entry target and does not replace any method body.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that callsites still pass the
  same `g_mptr_*` and `g_mientry_*` slots to call_stub dispatchers, and the
  helper remains the fail-closed path for null entry slots.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions and
  same-run timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3h.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: `neko_bound_method_i_entry_ref(ref)` now
  reads the cached interpreted-entry slot only when both cached `Method*` and
  interpreted-entry slots are populated; otherwise it calls the existing
  fail-closed `neko_bound_method_i_entry` helper. Focused generator/audit tests
  passed with `./gradlew :neko-test:test --rerun-tasks --tests
  dev.nekoobfuscator.test.CCodeGeneratorTest --tests
  dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest
  -Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp` (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 7s`). Fresh
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 41s`). Direct
  parity logs in `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10y/` completed five runs each
  without fatal markers: TEST original/native Calc medians `10 ms` / `87 ms`;
  obfusjack original/native medians Seq `2 ms` / `17 ms`, Platform `26 ms` /
  `43 ms`, Virtual `12 ms` / `36 ms`. Generated C in
  `build/neko-native-work/run-3262720662482/` contains the cached-entry macro in
  `neko_native_support.c` and `neko_native_impl_prelude.h`; callsites still use
  `neko_bound_method_i_entry_ref(&g_method_entry_ref_...)`; the fallback helper
  remains referenced for null slots. Executable forbidden-marker inspection
  found no `NEKO_JNI_FN_PTR`, `(*env)->`, `env->`, JNI call wrappers, array JNI
  wrappers, or JVMTI markers; remaining `FindClass`/`NewStringUTF`/`NewObject`
  strings are comments or `JVM_FindClass*` symbol names. No new `hs_err` files
  were created during this validation; newest root `hs_err_pid*.log` still
  predates the run.


### [rejected] NPT-3z: Runtime P6 primitive-array cold diagnostic outlining

- Scope: optimize only generated primitive array fast helpers by moving the
  unreachable-success-path diagnostic `fprintf`/`abort` blocks for primitive
  `xALOAD`/`xASTORE` direct-path failures into one cold, noinline, noreturn
  helper. The hot helper success checks, null/bounds semantics, primitive array
  layout reads, GC handling, and hard-abort behavior must remain unchanged.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that primitive array hot helper
  bodies call the cold helper on failure instead of embedding `fprintf`, and
  generated-C proof that no JNI/JVMTI/fallback/original-bytecode path is added.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: no runtime/fatal/forbidden-marker regressions; same-run
  timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3y; P6 remains open for
  other hot-helper diagnostic blocks not covered by this narrow row.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-21: source changed only primitive array direct-path
  failure diagnostics into a shared cold, noinline, noreturn helper. Focused
  generator/audit tests passed and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed,
  but direct parity in `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10z/` regressed relative
  to NPT-3y: TEST native Calc median `90 ms` vs `87 ms`; obfusjack native Seq
  `18 ms` vs `17 ms`, Platform `45 ms` vs `43 ms`, and Virtual `42 ms` vs
  `36 ms`. The source change was reverted before checkpoint.


### [rejected] NPT-3aa: Runtime P7 remove CHECKCAST success-path exception check

- Scope: optimize only translated `CHECKCAST` success paths. `neko_fast_is_instance_of`
  is classified as `never_sets_pending_exception` on normal return and hard-abort
  on missing metadata; the cast-failure branch calls the existing implicit
  exception raiser and immediately jumps to `__neko_exception_exit`. Therefore
  the trailing `if (!neko_exception_check(env)) { PUSH_O(obj); }` after a
  successful cast can become `PUSH_O(obj)` without changing JVM exception
  ordering, handler selection, pending-exception visibility, or ABI behavior.
- Required evidence: source/generated-C proof that only `CHECKCAST` success
  path checks are removed; failure paths still raise `ClassCastException` and
  jump to exception exit; no NJX, Java-calling, reflection, MethodHandle,
  direct translated call, or try/catch boundary checks are removed.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused translator/generator tests,
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct parity runs, and generated-C
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: generated C shows `CHECKCAST` success pushes directly,
  runtime and parity runs have no fatal/forbidden-marker regressions, and same-run
  timings improve or do not regress relative to NPT-3y.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-21: source changed only the `CHECKCAST` success
  continuation to push directly after `neko_fast_is_instance_of`; the cast
  failure branch still raised `ClassCastException` and jumped to
  `__neko_exception_exit`. Focused translator/generator tests passed and
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed, but direct parity in
  `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10aa/summary-p10aa.json` failed the no-regression
  gate relative to NPT-3y: TEST native Calc median `86 ms` vs `87 ms` improved,
  but obfusjack native Platform regressed to `45 ms` vs `43 ms` and Virtual
  regressed to `42 ms` vs `36 ms`; Seq stayed `17 ms`. The source change was
  reverted before checkpoint.

### [x] NPT-4: Compile-time post-P41 bottleneck selection

- Scope: choose the next native compile-time optimization only from the NPT-1
  fresh manifests and generated-source inspection.
- Required evidence: top compile-sum/max/wall-time rows for TEST/test21/
  SnakeGame/evaluator, generated source snippets for the dominant repeated
  generic code shape, rejected-shape comparison against P27/P29/P33/P34/P36/P37/
  P40, and a proof that the proposed change is source-shape or build-architecture
  generic rather than fixture-specific.
- Validation command or runtime target: read-only inspection of NPT-1 artifacts;
  no implementation in this row.
- Completion criteria: one concrete compile-time implementation row is added to
  `.plan/native-compile-parallelization-2026-05-17.md` with scope, required
  evidence, validation commands, and completion criteria before code changes.
- Dependency: NPT-1.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: selected `.plan/native-compile-parallelization-2026-05-17.md`
  P42 from the fresh NPT-1 post-P41 baseline. The baseline summary shows TEST
  compile sum/max `25439ms/1216ms`, obfusjack `41138ms/2053ms`, SnakeGame
  `9816ms/770ms`, and evaluator `45750ms/1629ms`. Source inspection of the
  top generated impl files found exact `if (!neko_exception_check(env)) {`
  continuation guards still widespread after P41: TEST `77`, obfusjack `301`
  with `82` in `neko_native_impl_39.c`, SnakeGame `61`, and evaluator `239`.
  Larger top-file repeated shapes were rejected by prior rows and are not
  selected: P33 string literal descriptors, P40 current-owner class macro,
  P36 method-pointer macro, P29 static setter refs, P37 fieldID elision, P27
  nested primitive-store fusion, and P34 helper shard rebalancing. P42 records
  a source-shape-only macro compaction target that preserves every exception
  check and does not implement the rejected P7/NPT-3aa check-removal route.

### [rejected] NPT-5: Implement the first post-P41 compile-time optimization row

- Scope: implement only the concrete row selected by NPT-4, preserving Zig,
  `-O3`, current target flags, native coverage, no-JNI/no-JVMTI policy, and
  runtime semantics unless the selected row explicitly proves an equivalent
  behavior-preserving code-shape change.
- Required evidence: the selected row in
  `.plan/native-compile-parallelization-2026-05-17.md`, focused tests covering
  the generated source contract, fresh manifests, direct runtime output, and
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/unit tests,
  generated-C hot-path audit, fresh native-only TEST/test21/SnakeGame/evaluator
  generation, direct runtime smoke, timing comparison against NPT-1, newest
  `hs_err` scan, and forbidden-marker scan.
- Completion criteria: at least one build-size/top-tail/wall-time metric improves
  without runtime regression, all fresh artifacts report `translated>0
  rejected=0`, and no rejected prior shape or fallback mechanism is reintroduced.
- Dependency: NPT-4.
- Rejection evidence 2026-05-21: selected compile-time row P42 was implemented
  and fully validated but rejected. Focused Gradle tests passed, fresh
  native-only generation under `build/p42-native-validation/` reported
  TEST/obfusjack/SnakeGame/evaluator translated/rejected rows `49/0`, `93/0`,
  `18/0`, and `122/0`, direct runtime was clean with no fresh `hs_err`, and
  generated-C inspection found `NEKO_IF_NO_EXCEPTION(env)` at rewritten sites
  with old exact continuation guards at `0`. The row failed completion because
  compile metrics were mixed and obfusjack no-debug runtime repeats regressed
  versus NPT-3y. P42 source/test changes were reverted before checkpoint; a new
  compile-time selection row is required before another implementation attempt.

### [x] NPT-5a: Select the next post-P42 compile-time optimization row

- Scope: choose the next native compile-time optimization from fresh post-P41/
  post-P42 evidence without retrying the rejected P42 macro-only guard shape or
  any previously rejected body/runtime shape.
- Required evidence: generated prelude/header sizes, implementation include
  counts, per-source compile tails from NPT-1/P42 artifacts, read-only
  generated-source inspection identifying the repeated generic declaration
  surface, and explicit rejection-boundary comparison against P27/P29/P33/P34/
  P36/P37/P40/P42 and NPT-3aa.
- Validation command or runtime target: read-only artifact/source inspection; no
  Gradle or runtime command for the selection row.
- Completion criteria: the owning compile plan records one concrete P43 row with
  scope, required evidence, validation commands, completion criteria, and a
  dependency/order reason before implementation starts.
- Dependency reason: NPT-2 and runtime rows remain open, but this selected row
  changes only generated source packaging/declaration inclusion for compile-time
  work. It must not alter runtime helper behavior or translated statement
  bodies, and the implementation row remains blocked on fresh runtime smoke
  validation before acceptance.
- Selection evidence 2026-05-21: selected
  `.plan/native-compile-parallelization-2026-05-17.md` P43. Read-only
  inspection found the canonical generated implementation prelude is included by
  almost every implementation file and is large in the NPT-1 artifacts: TEST
  about `353094` bytes/`6768` lines, obfusjack `410699` bytes/`7970` lines,
  SnakeGame `293653` bytes/`5569` lines, and evaluator `388879` bytes/`7251`
  lines. Obfusjack's hot `neko_native_impl_39.c` includes the full prelude but
  uses only subsets of numbered method-entry refs, method-id refs, field refs,
  class refs, inline-cache site macros, and method-pointer globals. P43 targets
  per-implementation sliced contract headers and explicitly does not change
  translated bodies, exception checks, strings, current-owner binding,
  method-pointer operands, static setters, field binding semantics, nested
  stores, or helper shard size.

### [x] NPT-5b: Implement P43 sliced implementation contract headers

- Scope: implement only P43's source-packaging change: generate per-impl sliced
  prelude headers for translated implementation sources while retaining the
  canonical full `neko_native_impl_prelude.h` for support/late-support shards.
- Required evidence: focused source-set tests, generated manifest/header-size
  data, fresh native-only TEST/obfusjack/SnakeGame/evaluator generation,
  generated-C inspection proving implementation body text is unchanged except
  include filenames and sufficient referenced declarations are present, direct
  runtime output, forbidden-marker scan, and newest `hs_err` scan.
- Validation command or runtime target: after explicit permission for
  repository `./gradlew`, run focused `CCodeGeneratorTest` and
  `NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest`, then fresh native-only generation with
  `.plan/native-only-full.yml`, direct TEST/obfusjack/evaluator/SnakeGame smoke
  with `-Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp`, manifest/header comparison, and
  forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: refreshed artifacts report `translated>0 rejected=0`;
  compile/link succeeds without fallback; per-impl header parse volume and at
  least one build tail/compile-sum/wall-time metric improves or remains within
  noise with no runtime regression; support shards still use the canonical full
  contract; no runtime semantics, compiler flags, native coverage, JNI/JVMTI
  fallback, skip-on-error behavior, original-bytecode fallback, or stale proof
  is introduced.
- Dependency: NPT-5a and P43.
- Completion evidence 2026-05-21: P43 is implemented and validated. The code
  now emits `neko_native_impl_N_prelude.h` for implementation sources and keeps
  `neko_native_impl_prelude.h` for support shards. A dependency-closure fix was
  added after focused audit exposed a generic sliced-macro dependency failure:
  retained `neko_concat_accumulate_string` needed `g_off_*` externs even though
  the implementation body referenced only the macro. Focused Gradle validation
  passed:
  `./gradlew :neko-test:test --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.CCodeGeneratorTest --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest -Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp`.
  Fresh native-only generation under `build/p43-native-validation/` produced
  TEST/obfusjack/SnakeGame/evaluator translated/rejected rows `49/0`, `93/0`,
  `18/0`, and `122/0`. Fresh run dirs
  `build/neko-native-work/run-8052435246015`,
  `run-8067151202699`, `run-8077119367912`, and
  `run-8091067486053` recorded generated C counts `67`, `113`, `34`, and
  `143`, and implementation header counts/sliced counts `50/49`, `94/93`,
  `19/18`, and `123/122`. Representative sliced headers are materially smaller
  than the full contract: TEST impl0 `299509` vs `356323` bytes, obfusjack
  impl39 `333519` vs `416657`, SnakeGame impl0 `275269` vs `295686`, evaluator
  impl104 `298320` vs `393898`. Direct runtime smoke with
  `-XX:+PerfDisableSharedMem -Djava.io.tmpdir=build/native-run-tmp` passed for
  TEST, obfusjack, and evaluator; SnakeGame preserved the expected headless GUI
  exception. Forbidden-marker inspection found no executable JNI/JVMTI/fallback
  markers in the fresh generated C/header/property set, and no fresh
  `hs_err_pid*.log` appeared in the validation build/runtime directories.

### [ ] NPT-6: Sync final validation plans after the first accepted optimization

- Scope: update `.plan/native-full-validation.md`, `.plan/native-full-repair.md`,
  and the owning runtime/compile-time source plan with the fresh evidence from
  the first accepted implementation row.
- Required evidence: commands, exit codes, output paths, generated C/native
  inspection, runtime outputs, timing rows, and rejection criteria status.
- Validation command or runtime target: no new runtime command beyond the owning
  row; this is an audit-sync row.
- Completion criteria: no stale checkbox is marked complete; every updated
  checkbox has a matching fresh artifact and evidence path.

### [x] NPT-3ab: Runtime P12 virtual/interface PIC-hit audit

- Scope: add only default-off diagnostic counters for the existing
  `neko_icache_dispatch` virtual/interface PIC path. The audit may count
  direct-C hits, direct-NJX hits, misses, translated-stub stores, direct-NJX
  stores, and unresolved exits in the existing `NEKO_DIRECT_DEBUG=1` stats
  summary.
- Required evidence: current source shows direct-C and direct-NJX hit branches,
  interleaved miss resolution, and only a per-site `miss_count`; previous P12
  declared-mid removal and cold-miss outlining were rejected. The new audit must
  prove the current hit/miss/target-kind mix before any further dispatch shape
  change.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests with
  repository `./gradlew` after permission, fresh
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, default-off TEST/obfusjack parity runs,
  one opt-in `NEKO_DIRECT_DEBUG=1` diagnostic runtime, and generated-C
  inspection.
- Completion criteria: generated C shows only audit counters/logging added
  around existing branches; default-off parity has no accepted regression; the
  opt-in diagnostic run emits useful PIC hit/miss/target-kind counts; no
  receiver-key computation, PIC size, target selection, miss resolution,
  direct-C dispatch, direct-NJX call-stub dispatch, handle scope, exception
  behavior, JNI/JVMTI fallback, skip-on-error behavior, or original-bytecode
  fallback changes.
- Completion evidence: focused `CCodeGeneratorTest` and
  `NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest` passed; fresh
  `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed; opt-in TEST audit artifact
  `build/p12-icache-audit/TEST-native-audit.jar` generated with
  `translated=49 rejected=0` from
  `build/neko-native-work/run-9527959662306`; its build manifest recorded
  `icache.audit.build=true` and compile commands containing
  `-DNEKO_ICACHE_AUDIT=1`. The opt-in `NEKO_DIRECT_DEBUG=1` runtime completed
  and emitted counters including `icache_direct_njx_hit=519999`,
  `icache_miss=43`, `icache_direct_njx_store=44`, `resolve_failed=0`, and
  `icache_unresolved=0`; a second loaded native segment reported
  `icache_direct_njx_hit=20`, `icache_miss=76`, `icache_direct_njx_store=77`,
  `resolve_failed=0`, `icache_unresolved=0`. Generated-C inspection found no
  executable forbidden JNI/JVMTI markers in the icache support path; remaining
  support-file JNI strings were comments or internal JVM symbol names.
- Outcome: the audit is accepted as measurement infrastructure. The recorded
  runtime mix is dominated by direct-NJX PIC hits, so no further P12 cold-miss
  outlining or dispatch-shape change is justified without new evidence.
- Dependency update: P2/P4 GC strict acceptance remains blocked by the fresh
  ZGC mask-publication abort (`ZGC oop load masks unavailable addr=0x0
  good=0x0`). This P12 row is measurement-only runtime hot-path debugging to
  guide the next performance change; it does not mark any GC blocker complete.

### [-] NPT-3ac: Runtime P13 raw-function flattening validation

- Scope: validate the existing structural raw-function flattening heuristic in
  `CCodeGenerator` without changing runtime code. The current source emits
  `NEKO_FLATTEN NEKO_HOT` only for translated raw bodies whose statement count
  is at or below `MAX_FLATTEN_STATEMENTS`, and emits `NEKO_HOT` without
  `NEKO_FLATTEN` for larger translated bodies.
- Required evidence: source line evidence for `MAX_FLATTEN_STATEMENTS`,
  `isLargeImplementation`, and conditional raw-function emission; fresh
  generated-C evidence showing both flattened and non-flattened translated
  bodies selected by statement count; runtime/performance evidence that the
  current source does not regress the accepted baseline.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused generator/audit tests with
  repository `./gradlew` after permission, fresh TEST/obfusjack native
  generation and runtime, generated-C inspection, and performance capture.
- Completion criteria: no owner/name/descriptor/sample-specific selection,
  no CFF block change, no bytecode translation change, no JNI/JVMTI fallback,
  no skip/original-bytecode fallback, and no accepted runtime/performance
  regression.
- Rejected validation 2026-05-21: the structural heuristic is generic and was
  present in source, but this row is not accepted as a performance win. Source
  evidence: `CCodeGenerator.MAX_FLATTEN_STATEMENTS = 128`,
  `fn.body().size() > MAX_FLATTEN_STATEMENTS`, and conditional raw emission at
  `CCodeGenerator.java:2150-2157`. Fresh TEST native generation translated
  `49` methods with `rejected=0`; generated C showed large
  `neko_native_impl_0.c` emitted as `NEKO_HOT` without `NEKO_FLATTEN` while
  small bodies such as `neko_native_impl_8.c` kept
  `NEKO_FLATTEN NEKO_HOT`. Fresh obfusjack native generation translated `93`
  methods with `rejected=0`; generated C showed large bodies
  `neko_native_impl_39.c` (`1085` lines), `neko_native_impl_44.c` (`181`
  lines), and `neko_native_impl_46.c` (`146` lines) emitted as `NEKO_HOT`
  without `NEKO_FLATTEN`, while small bodies such as `neko_native_impl_13.c`
  (`38` lines) and `neko_native_impl_0.c` (`30` lines) kept
  `NEKO_FLATTEN NEKO_HOT`. Runtime evidence: TEST native completed five fresh
  runs with Calc `86/90/85/90/83 ms`, median `86 ms`, which is below the
  accepted NPT-3y TEST median `87 ms`. Obfusjack native completed fresh runs
  with Platform `45/48/50/45/45 ms`, Virtual `47/37/39/48/43 ms`, and Seq
  `17/19/17/17/17 ms`; medians were Platform `45 ms`, Virtual `43 ms`, and
  Seq `17 ms`. One 120s run timed out after printing `=== All tests completed
  ===`; a 180s rerun exited `0` with Platform `44 ms`, Virtual `42 ms`, and
  Seq `18 ms`, so no crash/fatal/JNI fallback was observed. The row remains
  rejected because obfusjack Platform and Virtual regressed versus the accepted
  baseline and missed the performance gate (`Platform <= 44 ms`,
  `Virtual <= 35 ms`, `Seq <= 14 ms`). Do not change the flattening threshold
  or selection shape without new generated-code and compiler-layout evidence.

### [x] NPT-3ad: Runtime P14 opt-in native compiler diagnostics

- Scope: add only an optional native compiler diagnostics mode controlled by
  `NEKO_NATIVE_OPT_DIAGNOSTICS=1`. The mode may add clang/zig optimization
  record flags and manifest entries for per-source diagnostic files.
- Required evidence: `NativeBuildEngine` currently records debug and icache
  audit build flags and assembles common compile flags, but has no
  optimization-diagnostics flag or per-source diagnostics manifest paths.
- Validation command or runtime target: focused Gradle tests with repository
  `./gradlew` after permission, one normal native generation proving default
  compile commands are unchanged and diagnostics disabled, one opt-in native
  generation proving diagnostics enabled in the manifest/compile commands and
  producing inspectable compiler diagnostics or optimization-record files, plus
  generated-C forbidden-marker inspection.
- Completion criteria: default builds do not include diagnostics flags and do
  not change generated C, translated bytecode, runtime dispatch, JNI/JVMTI
  behavior, fallback behavior, or release compile/link flags; opt-in builds
  expose enough compiler output to guide P4/P6/P8/P13 without making
  diagnostics mandatory for normal artifacts.
- Completion evidence: focused `CCodeGeneratorTest` and
  `NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest` passed. Normal TEST generation
  `build/neko-native-work/run-9988143205398` produced `translated=49
  rejected=0`, manifest `opt.diagnostics.build=false`, and no
  `-fsave-optimization-record` or `-foptimization-record-file` compile flags.
  The first opt-in attempt rejected unsupported
  `-foptimization-record-format=yaml`; the accepted narrowed implementation
  generated `build/p14-opt-diagnostics/TEST-native-opt-diagnostics.jar` from
  `build/neko-native-work/run-10032888234072` with `translated=49 rejected=0`,
  manifest `opt.diagnostics.build=true`, compile commands containing
  `-fsave-optimization-record` and per-source `-foptimization-record-file=...`,
  and 67 `.opt.yaml` files under `opt-diagnostics/linux_x64`. Representative
  `neko_native_impl_0.opt.yaml` records inline pass diagnostics such as
  `AlwaysInline`. The opt-in TEST jar ran successfully with `Calc: 83ms`.
  Generated-C inspection found no executable forbidden JNI/JVMTI/fallback
  markers in the checked support/icache paths; remaining support-file JNI
  strings were comments or internal JVM symbol names.
- Outcome: P14 is accepted as opt-in compiler evidence infrastructure. It is
  not itself a runtime optimization, but it gives the next P13/P4 work a
  concrete inlining/optimization record without perturbing normal artifacts.
