# Native Path Performance Optimization TODO

This TODO is based only on the current git-baseline source under `neko-native/` and native tests under `neko-test/src/test/java/`.

It intentionally does not use existing TODO files, project notes, memory files, or prior performance writeups as evidence. Every optimization item below names the current source location that motivated it. Items without enough runtime evidence start with measurement or generated-C audit work instead of assuming a bottleneck.

Hard requirement: every optimization in this TODO must preserve the JVM ABI exactly. Any change that violates, narrows, bypasses, weakens, approximates, or relies on undefined behavior against the JVM ABI is forbidden, even if it improves a benchmark.

## Repository Native Constraints

These constraints are imported from the repository `AGENTS.md` and apply to every item in this TODO.

- Do not implement or optimize for a special sample, benchmark, class, method, owner, descriptor, crash site, log string, or known test artifact.
- All changes must support all JVM features and must be generic, architecture-level changes.
- Do not jump to a later-stage workaround while earlier prerequisites are open. If order must change, update this TODO first with a plan-level dependency reason.
- Do not mark stale work complete. A stale jar, stale generated C file, compile-only result, unit-only result, or previous run is not proof.
- After a verified completed substep, commit the implementation and the matching TODO checkbox update before continuing.
- Do not revert or overwrite unrelated user work. Work with existing changes if they affect the task.
- Use the repository/system `./gradlew`; do not create, copy, or use a temporary `gradlew`.
- No JNI fallback, soft fallback, skip-on-error path, original-bytecode fallback, or JVMTI is allowed.
- Do not add a new JVM runtime helper layer outside the planned native/bootstrap surface.
- Do not add new Java-side bootstrap behavior or new `<clinit>` behavior beyond the existing native-loader entry.
- `JNI_OnLoad` must stay minimal: `GetEnv`, capture anchors, initialize native metadata, then stop using the JNI function table.
- Outside the minimal `JNI_OnLoad` path, generated/runtime native code must not use `NEKO_JNI_FN_PTR`, `(*env)->`, `env->`, `Call*Method`, `Get*Field`, `FindClass`, `NewStringUTF`, `NewObject*`, `Throw*`, JNI monitor calls, JNI array calls, or equivalent JNI wrappers.
- Missing VMStruct, JVM symbol, class, method, field, string metadata, GC barrier, CodeHeap support, or call stub support must hard abort/error. It must not fall back to JNI, skip a method, or keep original bytecode.
- ZGC/Shenandoah compatibility must not be achieved by skipping classes or methods. Missing required barriers must abort.
- Resolver and bind-time subtasks must prove that the current bind/runtime path uses the resolved pointer, offset, or entry.
- Hot-path opcode subtasks must prove that the runtime jar executes the opcode through the new native path and generated C contains no forbidden JNI wrappers.
- Cleanup/removal subtasks must prove the removed fallback is no longer needed and missing capability paths hard abort.
- Never create files or folders in `/tmp`.

Status legend:
- `[ ]` not implemented / not verified
- `[-]` actively in progress only while that exact task is being worked
- `[x]` implemented, freshly regenerated, runtime-verified, inspected, and committed

## Source-Only Performance Findings

### Confirmed from current source

- The per-signature entry dispatcher always saves and restores a JNIHandleBlock window, even for primitive-only signatures and methods that may not create object handles.
  Source evidence: `SignatureDispatcherEmitter.renderOne` emits `neko_handle_save` unconditionally, then restores it on every return path.
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/codegen/emit/SignatureDispatcherEmitter.java:85-149`

- Translated raw functions always allocate operand stack, monitor records, locals, call `neko_hotspot_fast_require`, and receive `thread`, `env`, and owner/receiver parameters.
  Source evidence: `CCodeGenerator.renderRawFunction`.
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/codegen/CCodeGenerator.java:459-495`

- Shadow-frame bookkeeping is unconditional for every translated method and must stay semantically unconditional. It is required for translated frames to remain visible when this native jar is called as a dependency from any Java path that later observes `Throwable.getStackTrace()`.
  Source evidence: `NativeTranslator.translateMethod` sets `shadowEnabled = true` and emits `neko_shadow_push`; returns emit `neko_shadow_pop`; `Throwable.getStackTrace` consumes the shadow stack through `neko_shadow_stack_trace`.
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/translator/NativeTranslator.java:125-132`
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/translator/OpcodeTranslator.java:316-321`
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/translator/OpcodeTranslator.java:562-565`

- Exception checks are already coalesced at the translator level, but many opcode-specific paths still emit immediate `if (!neko_exception_check(env))` guards after helper or invoke calls.
  Source evidence: deferred `pendingHandlers` in `NativeTranslator`, plus direct checks in invoke/checkcast/string/switch paths.
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/translator/NativeTranslator.java:138-203`
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/translator/OpcodeTranslator.java:359`
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/translator/OpcodeTranslator.java:458`
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/translator/OpcodeTranslator.java:506`
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/translator/OpcodeTranslator.java:660`
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/translator/OpcodeTranslator.java:722-763`

- The current fast-state constant layer is only partially using the frozen const alias. Several `NEKO_CONST_INLINE` accessors still read `g_hotspot` directly instead of `g_hotspot_const`.
  Source evidence: `g_hotspot_const` is declared, but accessors for klass/compressed-oops/fast-bits/init/primitive bases/scales read `g_hotspot`.
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/codegen/CCodeGenerator.java:3786-3840`

- Many hot helpers still embed diagnostic `fprintf` argument construction directly in the inline helper body.
  Source evidence: `neko_fast_aaload`, object field helpers, primitive field helpers, primitive array helpers.
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/codegen/CCodeGenerator.java:5435-5466`
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/codegen/CCodeGenerator.java:5629-5734`
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/codegen/CCodeGenerator.java:5866-5925`

- Primitive field access uses `volatile` loads/stores for every primitive field access, regardless of whether the Java field is volatile.
  Source evidence: `appendPrimitiveFieldHelpers` emits `*((volatile <type>*)(oop + offset))` for get/set paths.
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/codegen/CCodeGenerator.java:5866-5904`

- Primitive and object array accesses still perform per-access null/bounds checks; there is no source-level loop analysis that can hoist range checks out of counted loops.
  Source evidence: `OpcodeTranslator.arrayAccessBody` emits checks per array opcode; fast helpers also check bounds.
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/translator/OpcodeTranslator.java:168-178`
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/codegen/CCodeGenerator.java:5435-5452`
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/codegen/CCodeGenerator.java:5907-5925`

- Nested-array fusion is a narrow peephole only: it recognizes adjacent `AALOAD; <int-push>; XALOAD`, not general raw-oop lifetimes or loop-invariant outer array references.
  Source evidence: `tryFuseArrayLoad` only looks at the next two non-meta instructions and rejects labels.
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/translator/OpcodeTranslator.java:88-143`
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/translator/NativeTranslator.java:472-488`

- Virtual/interface dispatch has a compact hit path, but miss handling still performs receiver klass discovery, exact mirror materialization, class linking, metadata method resolution, local-ref deletion, and NJX entry resolution.
  Source evidence: `neko_icache_dispatch`.
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/codegen/CCodeGenerator.java:4477-4567`

- NJX direct Java calls allocate/free a temporary Java handle block and zero stack buffers per call.
  Source evidence: `NativeToJavaInvokeEmitter` emits `calloc/free`, `call_params` memset, and `__jcw_buf` memset in the call-stub path.
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/codegen/emit/NativeToJavaInvokeEmitter.java:187-222`
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/codegen/emit/NativeToJavaInvokeEmitter.java:291-430`

- Raw oop to local-handle conversion allocates a new JNIHandleBlock with `calloc` when the current active block is full.
  Source evidence: `neko_direct_oop_to_handle`.
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/codegen/CCodeGenerator.java:4880-4917`

- The release native compiler flags are already aggressive (`-O3`, arch baseline, `-fno-plt`, `-fno-semantic-interposition`, `-fmerge-all-constants`, `-funroll-loops`), but there is no source-controlled optimization-diagnostics mode for validating inlining/LICM/code size.
  Source evidence: `NativeBuildEngine`.
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/codegen/NativeBuildEngine.java:43-94`

- The native performance tests currently enforce TEST Calc under 150 ms, but they do not record a structured native-path baseline for obfusjack matrix/thread timings or generated-C hot-path counts.
  Source evidence: `NativeObfuscationPerfTest` parses only Calc timing in the performance test.
  `neko-test/src/test/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/test/NativeObfuscationPerfTest.java:71-91`

### Things not to schedule as new work because current source already has them

- Do not add a TODO for direct manifest-local static/special calls as if it does not exist. Current source already emits direct C calls for eligible translated targets.
  Source evidence: `OpcodeTranslator.translateDirectInvoke`.
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/translator/OpcodeTranslator.java:729-769`

- Do not add a TODO for `AtomicLong.addAndGet` / `AtomicInteger.addAndGet` intrinsics as if they are missing. Current source already has direct atomic helpers and translator intrinsics.
  Source evidence: `translateIntrinsicMethodInvoke` and atomic helpers.
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/translator/OpcodeTranslator.java:567-584`
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/codegen/CCodeGenerator.java:5736-5758`

- Do not add a TODO for basic adjacent nested-array fusion as if it is missing. Current source already has the peephole and fused helpers.
  Source evidence: `tryFuseArrayLoad`, `appendFusedAALoadHelpers`.
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/translator/OpcodeTranslator.java:88-143`
  `neko-native/src/main/java/dev/nekoobfuscator/native_/codegen/CCodeGenerator.java:5763-5864`

## Validation Rules

- Before editing code for any item, record the runtime target row that proves the changed path.
- Do not mark a checkbox complete from source inspection, stale generated C, stale jars, compile-only success, or previous runs.
- After each completed item, regenerate the affected native artifacts, run the row's runtime targets, inspect stdout/stderr/native logs/generated C/`hs_err_pid*.log`, then commit only that implementation and this TODO checkbox update.
- Reject SIGSEGV, SIGABRT, verifier errors, VM fatal errors, `translated=0`, missing native libraries, skip-on-error behavior, JNI fallback, original-bytecode fallback, or new forbidden JNI function-table use.
- JVM ABI compliance is mandatory for every item. If an optimization cannot be proven JVM-ABI-equivalent for all supported JVM features, descriptors, calling conventions, object/reference lifetimes, thread states, exception states, stack frames, monitors, GC interactions, and class/linkage states, do not implement it.
- No performance item may drop JVM features, JVM ABI behavior, Java Memory Model behavior, exception ordering, monitor behavior, GC root visibility, class initialization semantics, stack trace visibility, or dependency-jar call correctness.
- Do not optimize by assuming this native jar is the main jar, the top-level entry point, a closed-world caller, a benchmark-only path, or a path where `Throwable.getStackTrace()` cannot be observed.
- Shadow-frame push/pop must remain present for every translated method entry/exit unless a future architecture provides a strictly equivalent always-visible translated-frame mechanism. Conditional omission, lazy reconstruction that misses already-entered frames, or method/body classification that hides frames is forbidden.

Runtime target groups:
- `R-build`: cleanly regenerate native artifacts with the repository Gradle wrapper.
- `R-test`: run the generated TEST native jar.
- `R-obfusjack`: run the obfusjack Java fixture.
- `R-native-obfusjack`: run the generated obfusjack native jar.
- `R-native-test`: run the generated TEST native jar under the native path.
- `R-inspect`: inspect generated C/native output, stdout, stderr, native logs, newest `hs_err_pid*.log`, forbidden JNI markers, and fallback markers.
- `R-negative`: prove missing required symbols/capabilities fail closed instead of falling back.

Performance and GC gates:
- Run `R-build`, `R-test` repeated 5 times, `R-obfusjack` repeated 5 times, `R-native-test`, and `R-inspect` for performance-sensitive items.
- Required medians per current user acceptance: TEST Calc must be same as or faster than the original JVM jar measured in the same run environment; obfusjack matrix-mul Seq must be <= 10 ms; every other parsed benchmark/test timing must be same as original JVM or within 1.5x slowdown. Any older absolute thresholds in this file are superseded by this stricter gate.
- If a threshold fails, make a new generic optimization commit and rerun the gate. Do not special-case the benchmark.
- GC strict compatibility requires TEST and obfusjack runs under G1, Parallel, Serial, ZGC with `ZVerifyViews`, and Shenandoah with verification enabled.

## Performance Optimization TODO

- [x] P0 Add a source-controlled performance baseline capture for the current native artifacts. Runtime target row: `R-build`, `R-test` x5, `R-obfusjack` x5, `R-inspect`. The capture must record JDK version, native compiler command line, generated C path, generated library size, TEST Calc timing for 5 runs, obfusjack completion timing for 5 runs, parsed matrix/thread timing lines when present, stdout/stderr paths, and `hs_err` status. This is required before making optimization claims because the current source tests only assert Calc under 150 ms. Source evidence: `NativeObfuscationPerfTest.java:71-91`. Validation: `R-build`, `R-test` x5, `R-obfusjack` x5, `R-inspect`. Verified 2026-05-04 with `./gradlew :neko-test:test --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeObfuscationPerfTest`; report: `neko-test/build/test-native/native-performance-baseline.json`.

- [x] P1 Add a generated-C hot-path audit. Runtime target row: `R-build`, `R-inspect`. The audit must count per generated C artifact: `neko_handle_save`, `neko_handle_restore`, `neko_direct_oop_to_handle`, `calloc`, `free`, `memset`, direct `g_hotspot.` reads, `volatile` primitive field accesses, `neko_exception_check`, `neko_icache_dispatch`, NJX dispatcher calls, inline `fprintf`, `getenv`, and forbidden JNI function-table spellings. It must report counts by helper/function region, not just global totals. Source evidence: current hot-path candidates are generated by `CCodeGenerator.java:459-495`, `SignatureDispatcherEmitter.java:85-149`, `NativeToJavaInvokeEmitter.java:187-430`, and `CCodeGenerator.java:4880-5916`. Validation: `R-build`, `R-inspect`. Verified 2026-05-04 with `./gradlew :neko-test:test --tests dev.nekoobfuscator.test.NativeGeneratedCHotPathAuditTest`; report: `neko-test/build/test-native/native-generated-c-hot-path-audit.json`.

- [-] P2 Generate primitive/no-handle dispatchers only for fully proven no-reference paths. Runtime target row: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`, `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, performance gate, GC strict compatibility gate. A method is eligible only if descriptor and translated body together prove there is no receiver reference, object/array parameter, object/array return, object allocation, array allocation, object/array load result, object/array field result, string operation, Java/NJX call, exception object creation, monitor object operation, or any helper that can create or expose a local reference. If any proof is incomplete, keep the existing handle window. This must be descriptor- and translated-body driven, not benchmark-driven, and it must not change GC root visibility or JNI local-reference lifetime for any reference-bearing path. Source evidence: current dispatcher saves/restores unconditionally in `SignatureDispatcherEmitter.java:85-149`, while raw functions already know params and emitted body in `NativeTranslator.java:98-208`. Validation: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`, `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, performance gate, GC strict compatibility gate; generated C must show no handle-window calls only for classified no-reference dispatchers and unchanged handle windows for all reference-capable dispatchers.
  - Current validation blocker row recorded 2026-05-06 for P2 GC strict prerequisite: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`, `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, GC strict compatibility gate. Fresh validation showed default/G1 native runs pass, but ZGC/Shenandoah fail before P2 can be checked complete because direct field metadata binding is wrongly gated by primitive raw-heap fast bits and string-literal binding still requires raw String allocation. Fix these as generic GC-capability prerequisites, not benchmark/sample work. Raw-disabled string literal binding must allocate through VM-managed non-JNI paths (stable JVM_NewArray plus existing NJX Unsafe.allocateInstance or exported VM intern symbol) and hard-abort if required symbols/barriers/metadata are missing.
  - Current validation blocker row recorded 2026-05-07 for P2 ZGC reflection prerequisite: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`, `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, GC strict compatibility gate. Fresh ZGC strict TEST run reaches reflected custom-loader invocation, then aborts in `java/lang/reflect/Method.invoke` caller-class materialization because the intrinsic uses runtime `self.getClass()` through a stale/cleared handle. Fix this generically by passing the lexical/current translated owner class for reflective caller-sensitive intrinsics, preserving JVM caller-class semantics instead of deriving it from the receiver runtime class.
  - Current validation blocker row recorded 2026-05-07 for P2 ZGC ReTrace prerequisite: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`, `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, GC strict compatibility gate. Fresh ZGC strict TEST now passes Loader after the lexical caller fix but aborts in ReTrace after `Throwable.getStackTrace()`/`AALOAD` because current-owner Class LDC still re-derives the current class from `self` and materializes a fresh mirror handle before dispatching on the stack-trace element. Fix this generically by using the translated method's lexical `clazz` ABI parameter for current-owner Class LDC validation/materialization, preserving duplicate-loader semantics and avoiding late receiver-handle dependency.
  - Current validation blocker row recorded 2026-05-07 for P2 ZGC object-local rooting prerequisite: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`, `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, GC strict compatibility gate. Fresh ZGC strict TEST still aborts in ReTrace after current-owner Class LDC was moved to lexical `clazz`: an object loaded through `AALOAD` is stored in a translated object local as a transient JNI handle slot, and later virtual dispatch cannot resolve that receiver. Lazy active-block local roots, preallocated active-block roots, and the attempted dedicated-root-below-scratch topology all failed; OpenJDK `JNIHandleBlock` allocation/GC invariants show a scratch block with `_top=0` and roots in `_next` can be zapped and is not GC-visible behind a non-full block. The next generic step is to make translated object locals mirror Java null as `NULL` and non-null values as direct/good-colored oops, reserve valid JNIHandleBlock root slots in the normal active chain for GC visibility only, update those roots on store/parameter/tail-recursive rewrite, and compare object refs by resolved oop identity rather than handle pointer identity, while preserving hard-abort behavior and primitive/no-handle dispatchers.
  - Current validation blocker row recorded 2026-05-07 for P2 ZGC pointer-mask prerequisite: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`, `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, GC strict compatibility gate. Fresh direct-local-oop TEST artifact aborts under ZGC in Field with a false `ZGC bad oop load` produced by the old single-sample high-bit mask fallback. OpenJDK 21u `zAddress` shows ZGC masks are dynamic low-bit `ZGlobalsForVMStructs` values (`ZPointerLoadGood/Bad`, `ZPointerStoreGood/Bad`, load shift); deriving `good=sample-high-bit`/`bad=other-high-bits` is invalid. Fix generically by capturing the real store-bad VMStruct pointer, using live ZGlobals pointers for all ZGC masks, and failing closed when those masks are unavailable instead of bootstrapping from an oop sample.
  - Current validation blocker row recorded 2026-05-07 for P2 ZGC local-handle prerequisite: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`, `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, GC strict compatibility gate. After removing the invalid sample mask fallback, fresh ZGC strict TEST fails closed during bootstrap handle resolution because `neko_handle_oop` applies the ZGC zpointer load-barrier mask path to an untagged JNI local handle slot before ZGlobals masks are initialized. OpenJDK `JNIHandles::resolve_impl` resolves local handles with a plain slot load; only global/weak handles use `NativeAccess` barriers. Fix generically by treating untagged JNI local handles as already-dereferenceable oop/zaddress values under ZGC, ordering that local-handle path before direct-oop classification while live masks are unavailable, while keeping tagged global/weak handles on the barriered path; apply the same canonical resolver to static-base mirrors so class/static-field bootstrap does not call direct-oop recognition on local jclass handles, and preserve hard-abort behavior for real field/array zpointer loads when masks are unavailable.

- [ ] P3 Reduce shadow-frame overhead without removing always-visible translated frames. Keep one push on every translated method entry and one pop on every translated exit path. Optimize only the representation and emitted call shape: replace three per-entry string pointer arguments with a generated immutable frame descriptor pointer, store one descriptor pointer per stack slot instead of three strings, and keep `neko_shadow_stack_trace` responsible for expanding the descriptor into `StackTraceElement` values. This must preserve dependency-jar usage where native-translated methods are called from unrelated Java code and `Throwable.getStackTrace()` is observed later on another path. Conditional omission, lazy materialization after the observation point, or method/body classification that hides frames is forbidden. Source evidence: `NativeTranslator.java:125-132` always emits `neko_shadow_push(owner, method, file)`, `OpcodeTranslator.java:316-321` emits return pops, and `CCodeGenerator.java:3114-3181` stores three strings per shadow slot then expands them in `neko_shadow_stack_trace`. Validation: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`, `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, performance gate, GC strict compatibility gate; add a dependency-jar stack-trace fixture where an external Java caller invokes translated code and later observes `Throwable.getStackTrace()`, and generated C must still show one shadow push and one shadow pop path for every translated method.
  - Partial implementation evidence recorded under `.plan/native-compile-parallelization-2026-05-17.md` P25: the generated runtime representation and call shape were changed to descriptor pointers and focused native-only validation passed for TEST/test21/SnakeGame/evaluator. This native-performance P3 row remains open for its broader dependency-jar stack-trace fixture and GC strict compatibility gate.

- [-] P4 Fix the const fast-state accessor layer. Accessors for post-bootstrap immutable values must read `g_hotspot_const`, not mutable-looking `g_hotspot`, unless the value is intentionally dynamic under a collector. Keep ZGC dynamic mask pointers mutable. Current source evidence: `NativeHotSpotFastAccessEmitter.java:66-84` declares `g_hotspot_const` and already uses it for `neko_const_array_length_offset`, but `neko_const_klass_offset_bytes`, `neko_const_use_zgc`, `neko_const_use_compressed_klass_ptrs`, `neko_const_compressed_oops_enabled`, `neko_const_compressed_oops_shift`, `neko_const_compressed_oops_base`, `neko_const_fast_bits`, `neko_const_initialized`, `neko_const_prim_array_base`, and `neko_const_prim_array_scale` still read `g_hotspot`. Dynamic ZGC mask helpers must keep reading the live `g_hotspot.z_zglobals_*` pointers. Validation row recorded before editing: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`, `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, performance gate, and GC strict compatibility gate; generated C or compiler diagnostics must show immutable accessor reads use `g_hotspot_const`, while dynamic GC mask paths remain mutable.
  - P4 implementation evidence 2026-05-20: immutable const accessors now read
    `g_hotspot_const` in source and in freshly generated TEST C
    `build/neko-native-work/run-3244581472985/neko_native_support.c`; ZGC
    dynamic mask helpers still read mutable `g_hotspot.z_zglobals_*` pointers.
    Focused generator/audit tests and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`
    passed. Fresh native-only P4 artifacts in `build/native-post-transfer-p4/`
    reported `translated>0 rejected=0` for TEST/obfusjack/SnakeGame/evaluator.
    Default direct runtime passed: TEST x5 Calc 35/35/35/33/34 ms; obfusjack
    x5 completed with Seq 23/23/23/22/25 ms. This row remains `[-]` because
    the full P4 performance and GC strict gates are not satisfied yet: TEST
    Calc is still above 20 ms, ZGC/Shenandoah still fail closed on the existing
    mask-publication blocker, and Parallel/Serial obfusjack direct strict runs
    did not produce a clean completion under the direct-run cap.

- [ ] P5 Split primitive field access into volatile and non-volatile paths. Current generated primitive field helpers use C `volatile` for every primitive load/store, which blocks useful compiler optimization for normal fields. Bind-time field metadata already carries `access_flags`; extend field binding so generated field slots expose Java `ACC_VOLATILE`, then emit volatile C access only for volatile Java fields and normal loads/stores for ordinary fields. Source evidence: all primitive field helpers emit volatile pointer dereferences in `CCodeGenerator.java:5866-5904`; field resolution records access flags in `CCodeGenerator.java:931-939` and sets them in resolution paths. Validation: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`, `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, performance gate, GC strict compatibility gate; add unit coverage for volatile and non-volatile primitive fields.

- [ ] P6 Outline hot-helper diagnostic failure blocks. Move inline `fprintf` / `abort` diagnostic construction out of hot helpers into shared `cold, noinline` functions. Keep the hot body as a small predicted branch to the cold function. Source evidence: inline diagnostics exist in `neko_fast_aaload` at `CCodeGenerator.java:5455-5465`, object field helpers at `CCodeGenerator.java:5647-5733`, fused helpers at `CCodeGenerator.java:5847-5854`, and primitive array helpers at `CCodeGenerator.java:5907-5925`. Validation: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`, `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, performance gate; generated C audit must show hot helper bodies no longer contain large `fprintf` blocks.

- [ ] P7 Remove redundant opcode-local exception checks only after helper effect classification. Build a table for generated helpers: `never_sets_pending_exception`, `may_set_pending_exception`, `calls_java`, or `writes_pending_exception`. Use it in `OpcodeTranslator` so direct helpers that return normally or hard-abort do not get a surrounding `if (!neko_exception_check(env))`, while direct translated calls, NJX calls, helpers that can call Java, helpers that can create Java exceptions, and all try/catch boundary-sensitive paths keep checks. This must preserve JVM exception ordering, pending-exception visibility, handler selection, finally behavior, and method-exit behavior. Source evidence: direct checks currently appear in `OpcodeTranslator.java:359`, `:458`, `:506`, `:531`, `:540`, `:565`, `:608`, `:660`, `:722`, `:763`, `:1060`, and `:1201`. Validation: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`, `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, performance gate; add generated-C audit proving fewer checks only where classified safe and runtime tests preserving exception order across caught, uncaught, nested, and finally paths.

- [ ] P8 Add loop recognition and range-check hoisting only when JVM exception semantics are proven identical. Build bytecode-level loop metadata from labels/backedges and prove induction variables, invariant array reference, monotonic step, dominated upper bound, no side effects before the original first failing access, and unchanged null-check ordering. When proven, emit one preheader guard and remove per-iteration bounds checks for covered primitive/object array operations. If proof is incomplete, keep per-access checks. This must preserve NPE vs AIOOBE order, the index reported by AIOOBE where applicable, side-effect ordering, deoptimization-free native behavior, and try/catch handler selection. Source evidence: array access is emitted per opcode by `OpcodeTranslator.arrayAccessBody` at `OpcodeTranslator.java:168-174`; fast helpers also check every access at `CCodeGenerator.java:5435-5452` and `CCodeGenerator.java:5907-5925`. Validation: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`, `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, performance gate, GC strict compatibility gate; negative tests must preserve NPE/AIOOBE behavior, side effects, and catch behavior when proof fails.

- [ ] P9 Generalize nested-array raw-oop lifetime beyond the current peephole without weakening GC safety. Track short-lived object-array element oops through a small SSA-like model. If an `AALOAD` result is consumed only by dominated array/field operations before any call, safepoint, allocation, exception creation, store, monitor operation, or escape, keep it as raw oop and skip local-handle creation. Materialize a local handle before any operation that may expose the object to Java, require a JNI local reference, or allow GC movement/relocation to matter. Source evidence: current fusion only matches adjacent `AALOAD; <int-push>; XALOAD` in `OpcodeTranslator.java:98-143`; regular `AALOAD` materializes handles through `neko_fast_aaload` at `CCodeGenerator.java:5435-5452`. Validation: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`, `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, performance gate, GC strict compatibility gate; generated C audit must show fewer `neko_direct_oop_to_handle` calls only in proven safe regions.

- [-] P10 Reduce NJX call-stub per-call allocation and zeroing. Replace per-call `calloc/free` of the temporary Java handle block with a scoped reusable per-thread or caller-owned block that preserves GC root visibility and nested-call semantics. Remove full `memset` of call parameter arrays when all used slots are explicitly written, while keeping required two-slot padding initialized. Source evidence: `NativeToJavaInvokeEmitter.java:187-222` allocates/frees handle blocks; `NativeToJavaInvokeEmitter.java:304` and `:348` zero buffers in the generic path; shape-specific generation also emits `memset` in `NativeToJavaInvokeEmitter.java:813` and `:844`. Validation: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`, `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, performance gate, GC strict compatibility gate; stress tests must prove no stale roots or handle-chain corruption.
  - Current implementation row recorded 2026-05-20: remove the per-call full `memset` of NJX `call_params` only. Every used slot must still be initialized exactly: one-slot primitive/object arguments write their own slot, float slots are zeroed before writing the 32-bit payload to preserve the previous high-word state, and two-slot long/double arguments zero the required leading padding slot before writing the payload slot. This is a generic call-stub stack-packing optimization for every NJX target, including original JVM/JDK functions; it must not replace any target method with native code or change which JVM function is called.
  - Validation update 2026-05-20: forbidden Math/libm and other named-JDK
    native substitutions were removed; generated run
    `build/neko-native-work/run-5500725993204` contains no
    `neko_fast_string_length`, `neko_fast_get_object_class`,
    `neko_fast_string_concat`, `neko_fast_atomic_*`, `__atomic_add_fetch`,
    `sqrt`, or `pow` calls. Focused generator/audit tests passed
    (`artifact://112`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
    (`artifact://114`). The row remains `[-]`: direct parity measurements in
    `build/native-run-tmp/parity-current/summary-after-generic.json` still show
    TEST native Calc median `135 ms` vs original `12 ms`, and obfusjack native
    Seq/Platform/Virtual medians `19/50/47 ms` vs original `2/25/15 ms`.
  - Implementation row recorded 2026-05-20: NPT-3b will evaluate the existing
    shape-keyed compiled-entry trampoline as the next generic P10 route. It may
    only pass `_from_compiled_entry` pointers for the same resolved Method*
    targets that call_stub currently invokes through `_from_interpreted_entry`;
    every owner/name/descriptor-specific Java/JDK method-body replacement
    remains forbidden. Validation must include generated-C proof, focused
    generator/audit tests, `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest`, direct TEST and
    obfusjack parity runs, and forbidden-marker inspection. Any verifier,
    stack-walk, GC-root, runtime, or target-selection failure invalidates and
    reverts the row.
  - Rejected row update 2026-05-20: NPT-3b compiled-entry trampoline was
    reverted. Focused generator/audit tests passed (`artifact://151`), but
    fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` crashed in HotSpot stack walking /
    `Throwable.fillInStackTrace` across `~BufferBlob::neko_njx_trampoline`
    (`artifact://153`, `artifact://155`, `hs_err_pid1442764.log`,
    `hs_err_pid1500630.log`). A frame-size adjustment from
    `8 + stackArgs + pad` to `9 + stackArgs + pad` did not fix the crash, so
    this route is not an accepted checkpoint and must not be retried without a
    new stack-walk invariant proof.
  - Implementation row recorded 2026-05-20: NPT-3c will trim only redundant
    wrapper-local register saves in `neko_call_stub_guarded`, preserving the
    same HotSpot call_stub target, Method* argument, entry pointer argument,
    JavaCallWrapper mirror, parameter stack, and thread-state logic. This is a
    generic bridge/context-switch optimization and remains forbidden from
    replacing any original JVM/JDK method body.
  - Completion evidence 2026-05-20 for NPT-3c: `neko_call_stub_guarded`
    now removes only wrapper-local callee-saved register saves and the
    compensating alignment word; stack-passed call_stub arguments, Method*,
    entry pointer, JavaCallWrapper mirror, handle scope, and thread-state logic
    are unchanged. Focused generator/audit tests passed (`artifact://167`) and
    `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed (`artifact://169`). Direct parity
    runs in `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10c/` completed with no fatal
    markers: TEST original/native Calc medians `11 ms` / `134 ms`; obfusjack
    original/native medians Seq `2 ms` / `18 ms`, Platform `26 ms` / `50 ms`,
    Virtual `15 ms` / `44 ms`. This is accepted as a generic bridge
    micro-optimization, but P10 remains `[-]` because original JVM parity is
    still not achieved.
  - Implementation row recorded 2026-05-20: NPT-3d will reduce only the
    JavaCallWrapper stack-buffer clear in the generic call_stub bridge. The
    cleared prefix must cover every wrapper and JavaFrameAnchor field written
    before HotSpot observes the wrapper, and all Method*/entry/argument/thread
    behavior must remain unchanged.
  - Rejected row update 2026-05-20: NPT-3d bounded JavaCallWrapper zeroing was
    reverted. Focused generator/audit tests passed (`artifact://179`) and
    `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed (`artifact://181`), but direct
    parity in `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10d/` regressed against NPT-3c:
    TEST native Calc median `136 ms` vs `134 ms`; obfusjack native Seq
    `19 ms` vs `18 ms`; Virtual `46 ms` vs `44 ms`. Do not retry this shape
    without a new measured reason.
  - Implementation row recorded 2026-05-20: NPT-3e will change only the NJX
    call_stub thread-state precheck branch shape so `_thread_in_java` is the
    predicted fallthrough. The native-caller transition and unsupported-state
    hard abort behavior must remain unchanged.
  - Rejected row update 2026-05-20: NPT-3e thread-state branch hint was
    reverted. Focused generator/audit tests passed (`artifact://186`) and
    `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed (`artifact://188`), but direct
    parity did not meet the no-regression gate: TEST native Calc values in
    `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10e/` were `137/132/136/137/134 ms`, the
    obfusjack native repeated run timed out once at 120s, and a follow-up
    obfusjack native check showed Platform `53/53/52 ms` versus the NPT-3c
    median `50 ms`.
  - Implementation row recorded 2026-05-20: NPT-3f will remove only the
    temporary `neko_call_stub_args_t` aggregate from the NJX call_stub guard and
    pass the same call_stub target, JavaCallWrapper mirror, Method*, entry
    pointer, parameter stack, result buffer, result type, and JavaThread as
    direct C ABI arguments. This is a generic bridge optimization; no original
    JVM/JDK method body may be replaced.
  - Rejected row update 2026-05-20: NPT-3f direct call_stub guard arguments
    were reverted. Focused generator/audit tests passed (`artifact://199`) and
    `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed (`artifact://201`), but direct
    parity in `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10f/` regressed on TEST native Calc
    `136 ms` vs NPT-3c `134 ms`, obfusjack Platform `51 ms` vs `50 ms`, and
    Virtual `45 ms` vs `44 ms` despite Seq improving `17 ms` vs `18 ms`.
  - Implementation row recorded 2026-05-20: NPT-3g will reduce redundant
    `JNIHandleBlock::_last` stores in generic handle push paths by publishing
    `_last = block` only on the transition from `_top == 0` to `_top == 1`.
    Overflow blocks and restore semantics must remain unchanged.
  - Rejected row update 2026-05-20: NPT-3g conditional `_last` publication was
    reverted. Focused generator/audit tests passed (`artifact://206`) and
    `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed (`artifact://208`), but parity in
    `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10g/` regressed: TEST native Calc median
    `137 ms` vs NPT-3c `134 ms`, and obfusjack native timed out once at 180s
    after four completed repeated runs.
  - Implementation row recorded 2026-05-20: NPT-3h will make only the
    shape-specialized NJX result unpack path return-kind-specific, avoiding
    integer-lane loads for FP/void returns and FP-lane copies for
    integer/object/void returns. The call target, Method*, entry pointer,
    arguments, handles, and exception behavior must remain unchanged.
  - Completion evidence 2026-05-20 for NPT-3h: shape-specialized NJX
    dispatchers now unpack only the result lane required by their return kind;
    call_stub target selection, Method*, entry pointer, arguments, handles, and
    exception behavior are unchanged. Focused generator/audit tests passed
    (`artifact://214`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
    (`artifact://216`). Direct parity in `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10h/`
    completed with no fatal markers: TEST original/native Calc medians
    `12 ms` / `134 ms`; obfusjack original/native medians Seq
    `2 ms` / `17 ms`, Platform `26 ms` / `50 ms`, Virtual `14 ms` / `44 ms`.
    Generated C in `build/neko-native-work/run-9173021508276/` preserved
    call_stub dispatch and no named JVM/JDK native method-body replacement was
    introduced. This is accepted as a generic bridge micro-optimization; P10
    remains `[-]` because original JVM parity is still not achieved.
  - Implementation row recorded 2026-05-20: NPT-3i will reduce only the
    shape-specialized NJX `__call_result` stack buffer from two machine words
    to one word after NPT-3h made result unpacking read a single lane. The
    call_stub result pointer and BasicType are unchanged; no target method
    behavior or selection may change.
  - Rejected row update 2026-05-20: NPT-3i single-slot result buffer was
    reverted. Focused generator/audit tests passed (`artifact://221`), but
    fresh `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` failed in
    `nativeObfuscation_randomRuntimeStableTenRuns` because
    `obfusjack-native.jar` timed out after 45s (`artifact://223`).
  - Implementation row recorded 2026-05-20: NPT-3j will make only the
    shape-specialized NJX `call_params` packing use constant slot indexes
    instead of a mutable `__njx_pos` cursor. The existing slot layout and
    zero-padding semantics for primitive, long, and double arguments must be
    preserved exactly.
  - Rejected row update 2026-05-20: NPT-3j constant-index call parameter
    packing was reverted. Focused generator/audit tests passed
    (`artifact://227`) and `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest` passed
    (`artifact://229`), but direct parity in
    `build/native-run-tmp/parity-p10j/` regressed: TEST native Calc median
    `136 ms` vs NPT-3h `134 ms`, and obfusjack native timed out once at 180s
    after three completed repeated runs.

- [ ] P11 Reduce local-handle overflow allocation in translated object-heavy paths. Replace `neko_direct_oop_to_handle` overflow `calloc` with a reusable block strategy or larger scoped translated-method handle window. This is separate from NJX because ordinary object array loads, object field loads, string concat, array allocation, and object allocation all route through `neko_direct_oop_to_handle`. Source evidence: overflow allocation is in `CCodeGenerator.java:4880-4917`, and callers include `neko_fast_aaload` at `CCodeGenerator.java:5435-5452`, object field helpers at `CCodeGenerator.java:5629-5734`, and allocation helpers at `CCodeGenerator.java:4919-4988`. Validation: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`, `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, performance gate, GC strict compatibility gate.

- [ ] P12 Add a generic virtual/interface PIC-hit fast stub audit before changing dispatch. The current `neko_icache_dispatch` already has direct-C and direct-NJX hit branches, so do not redesign it blindly. First measure generated hit/miss counts and emitted branch shape; then, only if hot misses or hit overhead are proven, split cold miss resolution into a noinline function and keep the hit path as receiver-key lookup plus direct target call. Source evidence: hit and miss paths are interleaved in `CCodeGenerator.java:4477-4567`; translator emits virtual dispatch sites at `OpcodeTranslator.java:466-510`. Validation: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`, `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, performance gate.

- [ ] P13 Tune raw function flattening by generated body size. `NEKO_FLATTEN` is currently applied to every raw translated function. Add a generic heuristic that keeps flattening for small/hot straight-line bodies but avoids flattening very large functions where cold blocks and helper expansions inflate instruction-cache footprint. This must be driven by generated statement/body size, not owner/method names. Source evidence: unconditional `NEKO_FLATTEN NEKO_HOT` is emitted at `CCodeGenerator.java:459-467`. Validation: `R-build`, `R-test`, `R-obfusjack`, `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`, performance gate; compare generated C size, native library size, and medians.

- [ ] P14 Add native compiler optimization diagnostics mode. Add a repository-controlled environment flag that appends compiler diagnostics such as optimization remarks, inlining reports, assembly, or equivalent zig/clang output for selected generated C artifacts, without changing normal release flags. Use this to verify P4/P6/P8/P13 rather than guessing about compiler behavior. Source evidence: `NativeBuildEngine.java:43-94` currently supports debug/release flags but no optimization-report mode. Validation: `R-build`, `R-inspect`; diagnostics mode must be optional and must not affect normal native artifacts.

- [ ] P15 Tighten native performance tests after P0 baseline exists. Extend native performance tests to record and assert TEST Calc median plus obfusjack parsed matrix/thread medians when those output lines are present. Keep thresholds relative to the immediate baseline until stable absolute gates are justified by current-source measurements. Source evidence: current perf tests only parse TEST Calc at `NativeObfuscationPerfTest.java:71-91`; obfusjack integration currently checks completion, not performance, at `NativeObfuscationIntegrationTest.java:101-109`. Validation: `R-build`, `R-test` x5, `R-obfusjack` x5, `R-native-test`, `R-inspect`.
